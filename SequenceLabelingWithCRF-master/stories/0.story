 Prakhar think it is time that we decide on topic for the NLP project .  Mausam sir expects a paper from the batch .  Saket is too confused .  How can we read a paper . code it and improve the baseline within a month ?  This seems too much to ask for .  We can look for code of a paper online and directly jump on improving baseline .  Prakhar think finding a paper with code as well as dataset available will be a challenge . Saket appreciated .  Saket beleive working on things like Sentiment analysis will be boring considering we already have done an assignment on it . Saket asked  Are Prakhar familiar with generative language models ? Prakhar disagreed .  Prakhar too find them interesting .  But Ummm.. .  this is gonna be tough .  Prakhar think this will require a lot of hardwork .  Given that this semester is fully loaded . why do Saket want to try such a new thing ?  Saket too believe generative models are tough .  They will be difficult to train and implement .  Trying new things is what we are here for .  Challenges will always be there but we must learn to handle them .  Saket is up for this .  Prakhar think we have decided the domain then .  it is going to be on Generative Model for sure now . Saket asked  Rahul What are Prakhar planning of doing ? and Rahul replied  Rahul is planning of doing something to remove bias words from Articles . Saket appreciated . Saket appreciated .  We discussed too much in this chat . Saket asked  Prakhar . why do not we have something that can summarize the discussion ? and Prakhar replied  We can have something like auto discussion summarization that can be based on Generative Language Model . Saket agreed .  So Saket believe this is time to get started .
