 It is nearly 3 in the morning .  B is up this late because of the NLP Demo tomorrow . A appreciated .  The final presentation day .  Apparently we are supposed to think about a project .  Research about it .  Execute it and then improve upon it .  And then finally present it all in a span of a month .  Prof . Mausam . A appreciated .  A took a course under him last semester .  B is actually working on Conversation Summarization .  It is supposed to be a novel pipeline for abstractive summarization of conversations .  Will A stop talking and focus on the work already !  B need a break .  B is going to the night mess . A asked  What is project about ? and B replied  What will C eat ?  do not assume C always wanna eat .  Ok fine . C will eat Paneer Paratha .  A is assuming B have a dataset for the demo ready .  Well , what we are doing right now is a conversation .  C can use this in the demo . A asked  So A is being monitored right now ? C disagreed .  A can say that . B asked  So what are we talking about ? and C replied  We are talking about nothing .  B's  part of the pipeline is still unfinished .  it is the most important part .  It needs to be finished immediately !  A think A will leave B guys alone .  Best of luck for the demo .
