S1,"Sorry/NNP ,/, but/CC people/NNS have/VBP certain/JJ natural/JJ rights/NNS --/: keeping/VBG people/NNS from/IN being/VBG religious/JJ infringes/NNS on/IN that/DT ./."
S1,I/PRP am/VBP not/RB saying/VBG businesses/NNS cannot/VBP legally/RB do/VBP it/PRP --/: they/PRP can/MD --/: I/PRP am/VBP saying/VBG I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ pretty/JJ unethical/JJ ./.
S1,"it/PRP is/VBZ easy/JJ for/IN you/PRP to/TO sit/VB back/RB and/CC say/VB what/WP you/PRP are/VBP saying/VBG when/WRB you/PRP dislike/VBP religion/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT is/VBZ no/DT different/JJ than/IN an/DT employer/NN telling/VBG a/DT gay/NN employee/NN they/PRP cannot/VBP express/JJ themselves/PRP as/IN being/VBG gay/NN on/IN the/DT job/NN ./."
S1,"One/CD is/VBZ discrimination/NN for/IN being/VBG gay/NN ,/, the/DT other/JJ is/VBZ discrimination/NN for/IN being/VBG religious/JJ ./."
S1,"If/IN you/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB for/IN equality/NN ,/, then/RB be/VB for/IN equality/NN in/IN all/DT cases/NNS ./."
S1,Not/RB just/RB picking/VBG and/CC choosing/VBG your/PRP$ pet/NN issues/NNS ./.
S2,Once/RB again/RB jyoshu/NN ;/: I/PRP manage/VBP a/DT fast/JJ food/NN resturant/NN ./.
S2,Do/VB you/PRP agree/VB that/IN I/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB to/TO serve/VB boy/NN scouts/NNS and/CC evangelical/JJ christains/NNS ?/. My/PRP$ moral/JJ beliefs/NNS are/VBP against/IN them/PRP I/PRP should/MD have/VB the/DT right/NN to/TO turn/VB away/RP their/PRP$ business/NN ./.
S2,"After/IN all/DT they/PRP go/VBP against/IN my/PRP$ religious/JJ beliefs/NNS so/IN I/PRP can/MD refuse/VB to/TO serve/VB ,/, or/CC even/RB hire/VB them/PRP ./."
S2,Right/RB ?/. If/IN I/PRP use/VBP your/PRP$ logic/NN I/PRP should/MD beable/VB to/TO do/VB whatever/WDT I/PRP want/VBP and/CC use/VB my/PRP$ religious/JJ beliefs/NNS as/IN an/DT excuse/NN ./.
S1,"Mistaken/NNP notion/NN ?/. She/PRP said/VBD clearly/RB ""/JJ I/PRP have/VBP worked/VBN on/IN plenty/NN of/IN legislation/NN ./."
S1,"We/PRP enact/VBP the/DT will/MD of/IN the/DT people/NNS ""/VBP It/PRP sounds/VBZ to/TO me/PRP like/IN she/PRP is/VBZ a/DT legislator/NN ./."
S1,"that/DT is/VBZ certainly/RB the/DT way/NN it/PRP comes/VBZ across/RB --/: how/WRB could/MD you/PRP possibly/RB take/VB that/IN any/DT other/JJ way/NN ?/. A/DT better/JJR analogy/NN would/MD be/VB if/IN you/PRP were/VBD trying/VBG to/TO force/VB a/DT Jewish/JJ employee/NN ,/, whom/WP you/PRP KNEW/NNP was/VBD Jewish/JJ ,/, to/TO work/VB on/IN his/PRP$ sabbath/NN rather/RB than/IN being/VBG willing/JJ to/TO work/VB with/IN him/PRP about/IN that/DT ./."
S1,Or/CC to/TO suddenly/RB tell/VB him/PRP he/PRP has/VBZ to/TO eat/VB a/DT pork/NN sandwich/NN or/CC something/NN ./.
S1,"And/CC remember/VB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT different/JJ issue/NN than/IN benignly/RB serving/VBG food/NN ./."
S1,"we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN a/DT major/JJ religious/JJ issue/NN here/RB --/: gay/JJ marriage/NN ,/, to/TO religious/JJ people/NNS ,/, is/VBZ like/IN asking/VBG them/PRP to/TO approve/VB most/JJS any/DT bad/JJ thing/NN in/IN society/NN you/PRP can/MD think/VB of/IN ./."
S1,You/PRP have/VBP to/TO take/VB the/DT seriousness/NN of/IN the/DT religious/JJ view/NN into/IN account/NN here/RB somewhat/RB ./.
S2,Why/WRB ?/. It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB my/PRP$ problem/NN they/PRP have/VBP evil/VBN religious/JJ values/NNS ./.
S2,Do/VBP they/PRP work/VB for/IN the/DT state/NN or/CC God/NNP ?/. Does/NNP God/NNP pay/VB their/PRP$ paychecks/NNS or/CC do/VBP the/DT taxpayers/NNS ?/. They/PRP just/RB have/VBP to/TO sign/VB a/DT civil/JJ contract/NN ./.
S2,So/RB what/WP if/IN that/DT person/NN is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ person/NN able/JJ to/TO do/VB marriage/NN contracts/NNS in/IN the/DT area/NN ./.
S2,How/WRB does/VBZ the/DT state/NN ensure/VB that/IN gay/JJ people/NNS can/MD exersize/VB their/PRP$ right/NN to/TO marriage/VB if/IN the/DT only/JJ person/NN able/JJ to/TO perform/VB the/DT marriage/NN is/VBZ exempted/VBN from/IN perfoming/VBG the/DT marriage/NN based/VBN upon/IN religious/JJ beliefs/NNS ?/. ./.
S1,I/PRP just/RB think/VBP you/PRP are/VBP viewing/VBG this/DT the/DT wrong/JJ way/NN --/: making/VBG it/PRP more/RBR complicated/JJ than/IN it/PRP is/VBZ ./.
S1,It/PRP is/VBZ simply/RB a/DT provision/NN that/WDT allows/VBZ a/DT person/NN to/TO let/VB someone/NN else/RB conduct/VBP the/DT civil/JJ ceremony/NN if/IN their/PRP$ religious/JJ beliefs/NNS do/VBP not/RB allow/VB them/PRP to/TO do/VB it/PRP ./.
S1,The/DT same/JJ idea/NN that/WDT would/MD allow/VB a/DT Jewish/JJ person/NN to/TO pass/VB on/IN eating/NN pork/NN if/IN it/PRP were/VBD suddenly/RB expected/VBN for/IN him/PRP or/CC her/PRP$ to/TO do/VB it/PRP when/WRB it/PRP was/VBD not/RB before/IN ./.
S1,that/DT is/VBZ all/DT this/DT is/VBZ --/: let/VB us/PRP not/RB make/VB mountains/NNS out/IN of/IN molehills/NNS ./.
S2,Yet/RB what/WP if/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT one/NN else/RB in/IN the/DT community/NN ?/. How/WRB is/VBZ the/DT government/NN going/VBG to/TO ensure/VB gay/JJ people/NNS are/VBP able/JJ to/TO exersize/VB their/PRP$ rights/NNS ?/. ./.
