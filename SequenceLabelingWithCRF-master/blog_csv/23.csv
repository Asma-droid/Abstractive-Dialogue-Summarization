S1,New/NNP England/NNP and/CC New/NNP York/NNP will/MD probably/RB have/VB gay/VBN marriage/NN within/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ./.
S1,The/DT West/NNP Coast/NNP might/MD also/RB follow/VB suit/NN after/IN that/DT ./.
S1,I/PRP think/VBP the/DT recent/JJ wave/NN of/IN gay/JJ marriage/NN legalization/NN will/MD stop/VB for/IN the/DT next/JJ 20/CD years/NNS or/CC so/RB after/IN that/DT ./.
S1,30/CD states/NNS already/RB define/VBP marriage/NN as/IN between/IN a/DT man/NN and/CC a/DT woman/NN ./.
S2,do/VB not/RB be/VB so/RB sure/JJ ./.
S2,If/IN Congress/NNP removes/VBZ DOMA/NNP and/CC with/IN Roberts/NNP and/CC Alito/NNP on/IN the/DT court/NN same/JJ sex/NN marriage/NN will/MD come/VB to/TO the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT country/NN with/IN a/DT 7/CD to/TO 2/CD ruling/NN ./.
S2,Roberts/NNS and/CC Alito/NNP are/VBP constitutional/JJ literalists/NNS and/CC with/IN DOMA/NNP out/IN of/IN the/DT way/NN the/DT full/JJ faith/NN and/CC credit/NN clause/NN is/VBZ a/DT clear/JJ constitutional/JJ mandate/NN ./.
S1,"Can/MD you/PRP demonstrate/VB evidence/NN that/IN the/DT SCOTUS/NNP would/MD nullify/VB gay/JJ marriage/NN bans/NNS in/IN all/DT states/NNS ?/. If/IN the/DT SCOTUS/NNP was/VBD so/RB imposed/JJ ,/, why/WRB do/VBP not/RB they/PRP just/RB strike/NN DOMA/NNP down/RB right/RB now/RB and/CC then/RB declare/VB all/DT gay/JJ marriage/NN bans/VBZ unconstitutional/JJ ?/. Secondly/RB ,/, states/NNS can/MD choose/VB not/RB to/TO recognize/VB gay/JJ marriage/NN even/RB without/IN federal/JJ DOMA/NNP ./."
S1,"There/EX is/VBZ a/DT choice/NN of/IN law/NN doctrine/NN that/WDT allows/VBZ states/NNS to/TO not/RB recognize/VB other/JJ states/NNS marriages/NNS that/IN they/PRP find/VBP ""/JJ offensive/JJ ""/NN to/TO their/PRP$ own/JJ public/JJ policy/NN ./."
S1,States/NNS have/VBP been/VBN not/RB recognizing/VBG each/DT others/NNS marriages/NNS for/IN decades/NNS and/CC states/NNS do/VBP not/RB use/VB the/DT FFC/NNP clause/NN to/TO make/VB one/CD state/NN recognize/NN another's/NN marriage/NN ./.
S1,There/EX is/VBZ no/DT case/NN history/NN of/IN FFC/NNP ever/RB used/VBD in/IN this/DT way/NN ./.
S1,"Even/RB in/IN cases/NNS where/WRB it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN attempted/VBN ,/, the/DT legal/JJ argument/NN involved/VBN is/VBZ so/RB lengthy/JJ ,/, that/IN it/PRP effectively/RB prohibits/VBZ FFC/NNP use/NN due/JJ to/TO the/DT sheer/NN amount/NN of/IN hassle/NN and/CC legal/JJ proceedings/NNS involved/VBN in/IN winning/VBG such/PDT a/DT case/NN ./."

S2,It/PRP is/VBZ called/VBN the/DT constitution/NN of/IN the/DT United/NNP states/VBZ A/DT marriage/NN license/NN is/VBZ a/DT public/JJ act/NN and/CC record/NN ./.
S1,Which/IN you/PRP are/VBP obviously/RB ignorant/JJ of/IN ./.
S1,"You/PRP completely/RB failed/VBD to/TO respond/VB to/TO the/DT choice/NN of/IN law/NN doctrine/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN my/PRP$ request/NN that/IN you/PRP provide/VBP justification/NN on/IN your/PRP$ claims/NNS of/IN how/WRB each/DT Justice/NNP would/MD vote/VB ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN my/PRP$ challenge/NN to/TO you/PRP to/TO explain/VB why/WRB DOMA/NNP has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN declared/VBN unconstitutional/JJ if/IN your/PRP$ claims/NNS about/IN the/DT Justices/NNS were/VBD true/JJ ./."

S2,That/DT is/VBZ how/WRB I/PRP know/VBP how/WRB they/PRP will/MD vote/VB ./.
S2,As/IN to/TO why/WRB DOMA/NNP has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN declared/VBN unconstitutional/JJ is/VBZ because/IN there/EX has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN a/DT case/NN in/IN the/DT courts/NNS challenging/VBG DOMA/NNP and/CC so/RB has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN taken/VBN up/RP by/IN SCOTUS/NNP ./.
S1,I/PRP shall/MD do/VB a/DT little/JJ research/NN on/IN your/PRP$ claims/NNS ./.
S1,"Regardless/RB ,/, you/PRP still/RB failed/VBD to/TO address/VB how/WRB state/NN courts/NNS may/MD use/VB the/DT choice/NN of/IN law/NN doctrine/NN so/IN that/IN the/DT FFC/NNP clause/NN does/VBZ not/RB apply/VB ,/, and/CC if/IN it/PRP were/VBD ,/, the/DT sheer/NN complication/NN of/IN applying/VBG the/DT law/NN would/MD make/VB it/PRP effectively/RB prohibitive/JJ ./."
S1,"By/IN all/DT means/NNS ,/, post/NN up/RP the/DT FFC/NNP clause/NN again/RB so/IN you/PRP can/MD avoid/VB addressing/VBG this/DT ./."
