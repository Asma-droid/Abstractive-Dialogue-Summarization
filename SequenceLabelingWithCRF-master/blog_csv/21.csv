S1,do/VB not/RB you/PRP think/VBP that/IN in/IN 1909/CD it/PRP was/VBD probably/RB viewed/VBN mostly/RB from/IN a/DT moral/JJ standpoint/NN ?/. I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB they/PRP saw/VBD it/PRP the/DT same/JJ way/NN they/PRP would/MD see/VB black/JJ people/NNS ./.
S1,They/PRP did/VBD not/RB even/RB realize/VB that/IN '/'' homosexuality/NN '/'' was/VBD any/DT sort/NN of/IN innate/JJ thing/NN ./.
S1,It/PRP was/VBD entirely/RB behavioral/JJ to/TO them/PRP ./.
S1,"I/PRP tend/VBP to/TO agree/VB with/IN the/DT court/NN ,/, even/RB given/VBN what/WP you/PRP have/VBP said/VBD ./."
S1,I/PRP doubt/VBP for/IN 1909/CD it/PRP was/VBD about/IN prejudice/NN and/CC bigotry/NN --/: they/PRP genuinely/RB felt/VBD it/PRP was/VBD wrong/JJ ./.
S1,The/DT concept/NN of/IN gay/JJ marriage/NN was/VBD completely/RB foreign/JJ and/CC unknown/JJ in/IN 1909/CD ./.
S1,It/PRP was/VBD not/RB even/RB something/NN they/PRP conceived/VBD of/IN ./.
S1,I/PRP think/VBP the/DT court/NN is/VBZ saying/VBG that/IN they/PRP could/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN prejudiced/VBN against/IN something/NN they/PRP did/VBD not/RB even/RB know/VB of/IN or/CC conceive/NN of/IN ./.
S2,Hogwash/NN ./.
S2,"It/PRP was/VBD once/RB entirely/RB moral/JJ to/TO believe/VB certain/JJ races/NNS were/VBD inferior/JJ ,/, and/CC that/IN women/NNS had/VBD fewer/JJR rights/NNS than/IN men/NNS ./."
S2,Treating/VBG the/DT races/NNS and/CC women/NNS as/IN equal/JJ was/VBD not/RB something/NN even/RB thought/VBN of/IN by/IN many/JJ ./.
S2,"It/PRP was/VBD prejudice/NN against/IN gays/NNS then/RB ,/, and/CC it/PRP still/RB is/VBZ today/NN ./."
S1,This/DT is/VBZ not/RB really/RB true/JJ ./.
S1,"it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT popular/JJ misconstruing/NN of/IN morality/NN and/CC history/NN by/IN proponents/NNS of/IN modern/JJ '/POS rights/NNS '/POS movements/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB true/JJ ./."
S1,"there/EX is/VBZ little/JJ historical/JJ backing/NN to/TO the/DT idea/NN that/IN people/NNS believed/VBD oppressing/JJ black/JJ people/NNS was/VBD a/DT right/JJ thing/NN to/TO do/VB ,/, as/IN in/IN ,/, doing/VBG good/JJ ./."
S1,"There/EX were/VBD times/NNS they/PRP used/VBD an/DT argument/NN where/WRB religion/NN was/VBD wrongly/RB used/VBN to/TO justify/VB their/PRP$ behavior/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT is/VBZ a/DT different/JJ matter/NN ./."
S1,"If/IN you/PRP firmly/RB believe/VBP otherwise/RB ,/, I/PRP had/VBD challenge/NN you/PRP to/TO show/VB where/WRB people/NNS thought/VBD oppressing/VBG blacks/NNS was/VBD an/DT example/NN if/IN doing/VBG good/JJ ./."
S1,The/DT same/JJ goes/VBZ for/IN misogyny/NN ./.
S1,"Furthermore/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ beside/IN the/DT point/NN anyway/RB ./."
S1,we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN homosexuality/NN ./.
S1,"In/IN 1909/CD ,/, the/DT only/JJ thing/NN they/PRP really/RB understood/VBD about/IN the/DT issue/NN at/IN hand/NN was/VBD that/IN some/DT people/NNS engaged/VBN in/IN sexual/JJ relations/NNS with/IN people/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ gender/NN ./."
S1,"There/EX were/VBD no/DT articles/NNS about/IN ""/NNP homosexuality/NN ""/NNP as/IN a/DT trait/NN ,/, and/CC certainly/RB none/NN about/IN genetic/JJ causes/NNS ./."
S1,"It/PRP was/VBD understood/JJ entirely/RB from/IN a/DT behavioral/JJ standpoint/NN ,/, and/CC therefore/RB a/DT moral/JJ standpoint/NN ./."
S1,So/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB hogwash/VBN at/IN all/DT --/: they/PRP really/RB did/VBD view/NN gay/NN sex/NN as/IN immoral/JJ ./.
S1,"If/IN you/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB so/RB ,/, then/RB you/PRP have/VBP a/DT very/RB poor/JJ grasp/NN on/IN history/NN in/IN this/DT case/NN ./."
S2,This/DT kind/NN of/IN morality/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN nothing/NN but/CC ignorance/NN (/( which/WDT you/PRP admit/VBP )/) and/CC prejudice/NN ./.
S2,"What/WP kind/NN of/IN a/DT basis/NN is/VBZ that/IN for/IN a/DT so-called/JJ moral/JJ code/NN ?/. So/RB what/WP if/IN it/PRP involves/VBZ behaviour/NNS ?/. Gay/NNP people/NNS have/VBP sex/NN ,/, develop/VB relationships/NNS ,/, and/CC bond/NN ,/, just/RB like/IN everyone/NN else/RB ,/, but/CC in/IN a/DT way/NN that/WDT reflects/VBZ their/PRP$ gay/JJ sexuality/NN ./."
S2,This/DT does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB people/NNS could/MD not/RB be/VB prejudiced/VBN about/IN the/DT way/NN gay/JJ people/NNS live/VBP ./.
S2,"People/NNS were/VBD ,/, and/CC are/VBP so/RB prejudiced/JJ ./."
S1,"A/DT better/JJR reverse/NN analogy/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN to/TO say/VB ""/NNP So/NNP then/RB conversly/RB I/PRP have/VBP the/DT right/NN to/TO advocate/VB that/DT heterosexual/JJ relations/NNS are/VBP morally/RB wrong/JJ ""/NN ./."
S1,"Not/RB heterosexuality/NN ,/, since/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB homosexuality/NN (/( as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT state/NN of/IN being/VBG )/) that/IN religious/JJ people/NNS have/VBP a/DT problem/NN with/IN ./."
S1,"Heck/NNP ,/, they/PRP often/RB do/VBP not/RB even/RB recognize/VB it/PRP ./."
S1,"With/IN that/DT caveat/NN ,/, yes/UH you/PRP are/VBP certainly/RB free/JJ to/TO advocate/VB whatever/WDT you/PRP want/VBP to/TO be/VB morally/RB wrong/JJ ./."
S1,"(/( And/CC unlike/IN the/DT way/NN some/DT in/IN your/PRP$ movement/NN do/VBP ,/, I/PRP will/MD not/RB call/VB you/PRP a/DT ""/JJ bigot/NN ""/NN for/IN doing/VBG so!/NN )/) It/PRP may/MD have/VB been/VBN based/VBN on/IN ""/JJ ignorance/NN ""/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP reject/VBP the/DT notion/NN it/PRP was/VBD based/VBN on/IN prejudice/NN (/( and/CC therefore/RB I/PRP tend/VBP to/TO agree/VB with/IN the/DT 6/CD -/: 0/CD view/NN of/IN the/DT justices/NNS here/RB )/) ./."
S1,The/DT 1909/CD society/NN had/VBD too/RB little/JJ understanding/NN of/IN gay/JJ people/NNS to/TO be/VB prejudiced/VBN over/IN in/IN the/DT first/JJ place/NN ./.
S1,"Remember/NNP ,/, homosexuality/NN was/VBD not/RB understood/JJ as/IN a/DT state/NN of/IN being/VBG at/IN that/DT time/NN ./."
S1,The/DT term/NN itself/PRP had/VBD not/RB been/VBN around/IN long/RB and/CC was/VBD not/RB known/VBN to/TO most/JJS people/NNS ./.
S1,"And/CC even/RB to/TO those/DT it/PRP was/VBD known/VBN to/TO ,/, it/PRP was/VBD not/RB known/VBN as/IN a/DT state/NN of/IN being/VBG ./."
S1,And/CC there/EX certainly/RB was/VBD no/DT social/JJ identity/NN among/IN gay/JJ people/NNS as/IN a/DT group/NN --/: how/WRB could/MD prejudice/VB have/VB existed/VBN if/IN there/EX was/VBD nothing/NN (/( from/IN their/PRP$ perspective/NN )/) to/TO be/VB prejudiced/VBN toward/IN ?/. ./.
S2,Right/RB ./.
S2,"Provided/NNP gays/NNS do/VBP not/RB live/VB gay/NN ,/, but/CC live/JJ straight/NN ,/, gays/NNS can/MD be/VB as/RB gay/JJ as/IN they/PRP want/VBP ./."
S2,"As/RB long/RB as/IN gays/NNS do/VBP not/RB outwardly/RB show/VBP what/WP makes/VBZ them/PRP different/JJ from/IN straights/NNS ,/, gays/NNS can/MD be/VB as/RB gay/JJ as/IN they/PRP want/VBP ./."
S2,it/PRP is/VBZ bs/JJ ./.
S2,"Also/RB some/DT may/MD not/RB recognize/VB the/DT existence/NN of/IN gay/JJ people/NNS or/CC their/PRP$ gay/NN lives/NNS ,/, but/CC that/DT is/VBZ putting/VBG one's/JJ head/NN in/IN the/DT sand/NN ./."
S2,Nonsense/NN ./.
S2,"People/NNS would/MD widely/RB and/CC hatefully/RB use/VB the/DT term/NN ""/NNP sodomite/RB ""/VBZ to/TO refer/VB to/TO gays/VB ./."
S2,"Before/IN that/DT the/DT term/NN was/VBD ""/VBN molly/RB ""/JJ ./."
S2,Clearly/RB there/EX was/VBD an/DT identity/NN they/PRP were/VBD prejudiced/VBN towards/NNS ./.
S2,"They/PRP were/VBD rounding/VBG up/RP gays/NNS in/IN areas/NNS they/PRP were/VBD known/VBN to/TO attend/VB ,/, and/CC putting/VBG them/PRP in/IN prison/NN ./."
S2,Read/VBN up/RP on/IN the/DT trial/NN of/IN Oscar/NNP Wilde/NNP ./.
S2,"Gays/NNS may/MD have/VB been/VBN forced/VBN underground/JJ ,/, to/TO a/DT greater/JJR extent/NN ,/, but/CC that/IN does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB they/PRP were/VBD not/RB thought/VBN of/IN ./."
S2,Gays/NNS were/VBD just/RB not/RB thought/VBN of/IN in/IN a/DT nice/JJ way/NN ./.
S2,"Gays/NNS were/VBD purposely/RB kept/VBN out/IN of/IN everything/NN in/IN society/NN ,/, when/WRB society/NN did/VBD not/RB really/RB think/VB of/IN gays/NNS as/IN human/JJ too/RB ./."
S2,That/DT is/VBZ not/RB prejudice/RB ?/. ./.
