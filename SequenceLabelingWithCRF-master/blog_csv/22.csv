S1,We/PRP all/DT know/VBP the/DT possibility/NN exists/NNS ./.
S1,"I/PRP simply/RB have/VBP not/RB seen/VBN anyone/NN present/JJ any/DT even/RB half/JJ way/NN convincing/VBG argument/NN that/IN any/DT of/IN those/DT possibilities/NNS are/VBP ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, a/DT reality/NN ./."
S1,"All/DT you/PRP are/VBP saying/VBG is/VBZ ""/JJ They/PRP say/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ morals/NNS ""/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ no/DT argument/NN at/IN all/DT ./."
S1,"Calling/VBG a/DT tail/NN a/DT leg/NN ,/, etc/FW ./."
S2,"Furthermore/RB ,/, why/WRB do/VBP you/PRP start/VB with/IN the/DT premise/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ prejudice/JJ ,/, rather/RB than/IN needing/VBG proof/NN of/IN that/DT (/( instead/RB expecting/VBG proof/NN of/IN a/DT negative/JJ --/: that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB )/) ?/. ./."
S1,"I/PRP did/VBD not/RB start/VB with/IN that/DT premise/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ simply/RB the/DT most/RBS likely/JJ answer/NN ./."
S1,"I/PRP know/VBP of/IN no/DT moral/JJ system/NN that/WDT condones/VBZ hurting/VBG others/NNS when/WRB said/VBD harm/NN is/VBZ not/RB preventing/VBG some/DT other/JJ harm/NN ,/, so/IN morals/NNS are/VBP out/RP ./."
S1,"Religion/NN is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ reason/NN for/IN choosing/VBG your/PRP$ own/JJ actions/NNS but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ no/DT reason/NN for/IN telling/VBG others/NNS how/WRB to/TO live/VB ,/, so/IN that/DT is/VBZ out/RP ./."
S1,"Prejudice/NNP against/IN gays/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN around/IN for/IN ages/NNS ,/, so/IN that/DT is/VBZ quite/RB likely/JJ ./."
S1,And/CC no/DT other/JJ explanations/NNS come/VBP to/TO mind/VB ./.
S1,Straight/NNP forward/NN ./.
S1,"I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ I/PRP have/VBP explained/VBN this/DT to/TO you/PRP before/IN ,/, and/CC have/VBP invited/VBN you/PRP to/TO come/VB up/RP with/IN alternate/JJ explanations/NNS ./."
S1,I/PRP do/VBP so/RB again/RB ./.
S1,I/PRP am/VBP particularly/RB interested/JJ to/TO see/VB your/PRP$ response/NN now/RB that/IN you/PRP seem/VBP to/TO have/VB gotten/VBN over/RP the/DT idea/NN that/WDT simply/RB calling/VBG something/NN moral/JJ or/CC religious/JJ does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN it/PRP cannot/VBZ be/VB prejudice/VBN at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ./.
S2,And/CC neither/DT does/VBZ Christianity/NNP ./.
S2,It/PRP TOO/NNP is/VBZ a/DT moral/JJ system/NN ./.
S2,"that/DT is/VBZ why/WRB when/WRB people/NNS claim/VBP religion/NN in/IN their/PRP$ acts/NNS of/IN prejudice/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP actually/RB abandoning/VBG that/IN moral/JJ system/NN ,/, rather/RB than/IN engaging/VBG in/IN it/PRP ./."
S2,"So/RB yes/RB ,/, morals/NNS are/VBP out/IN --/: I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ you/PRP are/VBP seeing/VBG that/IN now/RB ./."
S1,So/RB you/PRP finally/RB see/VB that/IN people/NNS can/MD claim/VB a/DT moral/JJ or/CC religious/JJ stance/NN while/IN not/RB actually/RB having/VBG one/CD ?/. Excellent!/NNP Glad/NNP to/TO hear/VB it/PRP ./.
S1,"Now/RB ,/, care/NN to/TO address/VB the/DT matter/NN at/IN hand/NN ?/. Can/MD you/PRP show/VB me/PRP ,/, preferably/RB in/IN reality/NN as/IN opposed/VBN to/TO a/DT hypothetical/JJ ,/, how/WRB one/CD could/MD justify/VB pushing/VBG an/DT anti-gay/JJ agenda/NN based/VBN on/IN actual/JJ morals/NNS or/CC religion/NN ?/. Because/IN I/PRP have/VBP never/RB seen/VBN it/PRP myself/PRP ./."
S2,Nice/JJ attempt/NN at/IN trying/VBG to/TO refute/VB a/DT point/NN that/WDT has/VBZ not/RB even/RB been/VBN made/VBN here/RB ./.
S2,The/DT matter/NN at/IN hand/NN is/VBZ that/IN prejudice/NN may/MD in/IN fact/NN not/RB be/VB what/WP is/VBZ behind/JJ people's/JJ opposition/NN to/TO gays/VB being/VBG in/IN romantic/JJ relationships/NNS ./.
S2,"In/IN some/DT cases/NNS (/( well/RB ,/, I/PRP had/VBD say/VBP MANY/JJ cases/NNS )/) it/PRP is/VBZ religious/JJ belief/NN ,/, which/WDT may/MD be/VB separate/JJ from/IN prejudice/NN ./."
S2,The/DT people/NNS I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN around/IN who/WP fel/VBP that/DT way/NN were/VBD doing/VBG it/PRP because/IN of/IN their/PRP$ religious/JJ beliefs/NNS ./.
S2,"In/IN fact/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ MY/NNP reason/NN as/RB well/RB ./."
S1,Actually/RB it/PRP was/VBD my/PRP$ point/NN ./.
S1,you/PRP have/VBP refused/VBN to/TO acknowledge/VB this/DT so/RB many/JJ times/NNS in/IN the/DT past/NN that/IN I/PRP could/MD not/RB even/RB count/VB ./.
S1,I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ you/PRP are/VBP past/IN it/PRP now/RB ./.
S1,"Fine/NNP ,/, than/IN if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ your/PRP$ reasoning/VBG than/IN spell/VB it/PRP out/RP for/IN me/PRP ./."
S1,"do/VB not/RB worry/VB about/IN anyone/NN else's/NN reasoning/NN ,/, just/RB give/VB me/PRP yours/VB ./."
S1,"Take/VB me/PRP ,/, step/NN by/IN step/NN ,/, from/IN ""/NN this/DT is/VBZ my/PRP$ religious/JJ belief/NN ""/NN to/TO ""/VB therefore/RB other/JJ people/NNS should/MD not/RB be/VB gay/VBN (/( or/CC act/VB gay/NN or/CC whatever/WDT )/) ""/NN ./."
S1,"Leave/VB nothing/NN out/RP ,/, spell/VB out/RP your/PRP$ assumptions/NNS ,/, give/VB me/PRP the/DT whole/JJ ball/NN of/IN wax/NN ./."
S1,Because/IN in/IN all/DT my/PRP$ years/NNS I/PRP have/VBP never/RB once/RB seen/VBN anyone/NN come/VBN close/RB to/TO doing/VBG so/RB without/IN resorting/VBG to/TO prejudice/VB ./.
S1,"For/IN bonus/NN points/NNS extend/VBP it/PRP all/PDT the/DT way/NN to/TO ""/VB and/CC so/RB public/JJ policy/NN disadvantageous/JJ to/TO gays/VB should/MD be/VB enacted/VBN ""/JJ ./."
S2,I/PRP have/VBP NEVER/NNP said/VBD that/IN people/NNS cannot/VBP claim/NN to/TO have/VB a/DT moral/JJ belief/NN and/CC not/RB really/RB have/VB one/CD ./.
S2,People/NNS can/MD conceivably/RB lie/VB about/IN anything/NN --/: we/PRP cannot/VBP base/VB our/PRP$ discussion/NN on/IN the/DT worry/NN that/WDT people/NNS might/MD be/VB lying/VBG about/IN their/PRP$ stance/NN ;/: that/WDT could/MD be/VB the/DT case/NN in/IN ANY/NNP situation/NN about/IN ANY/NNP issue/NN ./.
S2,"No/DT ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT religious/JJ belief/NN ./."
S2,"there/EX is/VBZ no/DT more/RBR ""/JJ reasoning/VBG ""/NN to/TO it/PRP than/IN believing/VBG in/IN faith/NN that/IN Christ/NNP is/VBZ a/DT ressurected/JJ being/VBG ./."
S2,I/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ Biblical/NNP --/: it/PRP is/VBZ what/WP the/DT Bible/NNP says/VBZ ./.
S2,that/DT is/VBZ WHY/WRB I/PRP believe/VBP people/NNS should/MD not/RB do/VB it/PRP ./.
S2,"it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB so/RB complicated/VBN ,/, really/RB ./."
S2,No/DT one/NN is/VBZ saying/VBG YOU/RB have/VBP to/TO believe/VB that/DT way/NN ./.
S2,"But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT way/NN I/PRP believe/VBP ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ my/PRP$ business/NN ./."
S2,"If/IN I/PRP imposed/VBD my/PRP$ beliefs/NN ,/, that/WDT would/MD be/VB one/CD thing/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP don't/VBP ./."
S2,"I/PRP do/VBP not/RB impose/VB anything/NN on/IN you/PRP or/CC anyone/NN else/RB ,/, nor/CC do/VBP I/PRP want/VBP to/TO ./."
S2,Get/VB it/PRP ?/. ./.
