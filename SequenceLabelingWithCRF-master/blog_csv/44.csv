S1,Healthcare/NNP usually/RB applies/VBZ to/TO spouses/NNS ./.
S1,"Therefore/RB ,/, if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ illegal/JJ for/IN gays/NNS to/TO marry/VB in/IN VA/NNP ,/, he/PRP gets/VBZ no/DT healthcare/NN ./."
S1,it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT fairly/RB simple/JJ law/NN to/TO understand/VB ./.
S1,It/PRP works/VBZ the/DT same/JJ way/NN with/IN a/DT straight/JJ guy/NN who/WP has/VBZ a/DT girlfriend/NN ./.
S1,she/PRP does/VBZ not/RB get/VB healthcare/NN provided/VBN by/IN his/PRP$ job/NN ./.
S1,I/PRP hope/VBP the/DT gays/NNS who/WP are/VBP upset/VBN with/IN VA/NNP leave/VBP ./.
S1,It/PRP will/MD cause/VB less/JJR havoc/NN in/IN the/DT state/NN ./.
S2,Which/JJ part/NN about/IN not/RB allowing/VBG them/PRP to/TO become/VB spouses/NNS do/VBP not/RB you/PRP get/VB ?/. The/DT straight/JJ guy/NN can/MD marry/VB his/PRP$ girlfriend/NN so/IN she/PRP gets/VBZ the/DT benefits/NNS ./.
S1,"And/CC the/DT point/NN is/VBZ ,/, in/IN VA/NNP gays/NNS cannot/VBP get/VB married/VBN ,/, therefore/IN they/PRP cannot/VBP share/NN their/PRP$ gay/NN lover's/NN healthcare/NN ./."
S1,Simple/NN as/IN that/DT ./.
S1,Hopefully/NNP gay/JJ marriages/NNS will/MD be/VB outlawed/VBN everywhere/RB so/RB we/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB to/TO continue/VB to/TO hear/VB them/PRP bitch/VB and/CC moan/VB about/IN healthcare/NN ./.
S1,"If/IN a/DT man/NN has/VBZ a/DT girlfriend/NN ,/, do/VBP you/PRP believe/VB she/PRP is/VBZ entitled/VBN to/TO get/VB healthcare/NN from/IN his/PRP$ job/NN ?/. ./."
S2,Actually/RB if/IN they/PRP cohabitate/VBP for/IN a/DT prescribed/JJ period/NN of/IN time/NN or/CC have/VBP children/NNS together/RB I/PRP would/MD say/VB yes/NNS ./.
S2,Commonlaw/NN as/IN it/PRP were/VBD ./.
S1,Common/JJ law/NN is/VBZ 2/CD words/NNS buddy/NN ./.
