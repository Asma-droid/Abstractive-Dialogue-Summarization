S1,Another/DT problem/NN with/IN the/DT study/NN is/VBZ that/IN most/JJS (/( or/CC at/IN least/JJS more/RBR )/) people/NNS in/IN the/DT country/NN very/RB well/RB might/MD identify/VB as/IN Christian/JJ ./.
S2,"Jyoshu/NNP ,/, you/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB how/WRB they/PRP conducted/VBD the/DT study/NN ./."
S2,"You/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB what/WP questions/NNS they/PRP asked/VBD ,/, or/CC what/WP they/PRP screening/VBG process/NN was/VBD ,/, or/CC anything/NN ./."
S2,"you/PRP are/VBP just/RB making/VBG up/RP objections/NNS ,/, and/CC deciding/VBG without/IN any/DT factual/JJ evidence/NN that/IN they/PRP apply/VBP ./."
S1,"Yes/UH ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ the/DT point/NN ./."
S1,I/PRP had/VBD prefer/VBN to/TO know/VB the/DT specifics/NNS ./.
S1,"Questioning/VBG a/DT study/NN is/VBZ a/DT VERY/RB appropriate/JJ thing/NN to/TO do/VB in/IN any/DT study/NN ,/, particularly/RB if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO vilify/VB a/DT group/NN of/IN people/NNS ./."
S2,"So/RB then/RB question/NN ,/, do/VBP not/RB just/RB state/NN that/IN the/DT study/NN has/VBZ a/DT problem/NN ./."
S2,"And/CC ""/NNP vilify/VB ""/NNP ?/. Good/NNP grief!/NN Where/WRB did/VBD you/PRP get/VB that/IN from/IN ?/. You/PRP seem/VBP to/TO be/VB taking/VBG this/DT a/DT bit/RB too/RB much/JJ to/TO heart/NN ./."
S2,"A/DT study/NN was/VBD done/VBN ,/, and/CC done/VBN well/RB from/IN all/DT evidence/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT results/NNS reported/VBD ./."
S2,No/DT one/NN is/VBZ vilifying/VBG anyone/NN ./.
S2,"If/IN you/PRP can/MD show/VB an/DT actuall/NN problem/NN with/IN the/DT study/NN ,/, and/CC not/RB something/NN hypothetical/JJ that/IN you/PRP came/VBD up/RB with/IN ,/, than/IN please/VB do/VB so/RB ./."
S2,"It/PRP seems/VBZ quite/RB professionally/RB done/VBN to/TO me/PRP ,/, but/CC you/PRP go/VBP ahead/RB and/CC dig/VB all/DT you/PRP want/VBP ./."
S2,"But/CC if/IN you/PRP are/VBP simply/RB uncomfortable/JJ with/IN the/DT results/NNS ,/, well/RB ,/, that/IN '/'' s/JJ no/DT reason/NN to/TO go/VB around/RP saying/VBG that/IN people/NNS are/VBP not/RB doing/VBG their/PRP$ jobs/NNS or/CC are/VBP out/IN to/TO vilify/VB others/NNS ./."
S1,Er/NN ./.
S1,that/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP pointed/VBD out/RP the/DT specific/JJ things/NNS I/PRP saw/VBD as/IN a/DT problem/NN ./.
S1,"Are/NNP you/PRP in/IN a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT reactionary/JJ mood/NN today/NN ?/. Yeah/UH ,/, because/IN in/IN my/PRP$ experience/NN in/IN these/DT forums/NNS ,/, here/RB and/CC elsewhere/RB ,/, an/DT enormous/JJ amount/NN of/IN attention/NN is/VBZ given/VBN to/TO trying/VBG to/TO make/VB Christianity/NNP look/VB bad/JJ ,/, through/IN generalizations/NNS ,/, citing/VBG irrelevant/JJ studies/NNS ,/, and/CC misrepresentations/NNS ./."
S1,"See/VB ,/, the/DT divorce/NN rate/NN of/IN Christians/NNP has/VBZ NO/VBN bearing/VBG whatsoever/RB on/IN the/DT gay/JJ marriage/NN amendment/NN ./."
