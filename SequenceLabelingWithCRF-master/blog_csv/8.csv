S1,It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP that/IN the/DT point/NN there/EX is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT bigot/NN ./.
S1,"er/NN ,/, spade/VBD merely/RB because/IN you/PRP CALL/VBP it/PRP a/DT spade/NN ./."
S1,"IMO/NNP ,/, if/IN someone/NN has/VBZ to/TO resort/VB to/TO name-calling/JJ ,/, it/PRP tends/VBZ to/TO only/RB indicate/VB they/PRP are/VBP having/VBG to/TO resort/VB to/TO something/NN besides/NNS sound/JJ arguments/NNS ./."
S2,Oh/UH my/PRP$ ./.
S2,"Perhaps/RB we/PRP should/MD say/VB it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT anti-gay/JJ bias/NN ,/, or/CC a/DT person/NN with/IN an/DT anit-gay/JJ bias/NN ?/. Are/VBP the/DT terms/NNS acceptance-challenged/JJ ,/, inclusion-challenged/JJ ,/, anti-discrimination/JJ challenged/NN ,/, appealing/VBG to/TO you/PRP ?/. E/'' Mutz/NNP or/CC his/PRP$ ""/JJ Joe/NNP ""/NNP ,/, assumed/VBD those/DT protesting/VBG against/IN gay/JJ discrimination/NN are/VBP nuts/NNS or/CC trying/VBG to/TO hijack/VB heritage/NN ,/, but/CC will/MD not/RB say/VB why/WRB ./."
S2,"If/IN it/PRP walks/VBZ like/IN a/DT duck/NN and/CC quacks/NNS like/IN a/DT duck/NN ,/, chances/NNS are/VBP ./."
S1,Or/CC maybe/RB he/PRP has/VBZ simply/RB arguing/VBG a/DT different/JJ point/NN than/IN you/PRP ./.
S1,"IMO/NN it/PRP is/VBZ just/RB simply/RB arrogant/JJ of/IN you/PRP to/TO automatically/RB write/VB off/RP disagreement/NN as/IN ""/JJ bigotry/NN ""/NN ./."
S1,"YOUR/PRP$ view/NN is/VBZ that/IN this/DT is/VBZ about/IN ""/JJ acceptance/NN ""/NN ;/: but/CC that/IN does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/DT is/VBZ the/DT real/JJ issue/NN ./."
S1,E/NNP Mutz/NNP is/VBZ right/JJ in/IN saying/VBG that/DT disagreement/NN is/VBZ not/RB the/DT same/JJ as/IN bigotry/NN ./.
S2,What/WP is/VBZ the/DT basis/NN for/IN the/DT disagreement/NN or/CC the/DT different/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT lack/NN of/IN acceptance/NN of/IN homosexuality/NN or/CC its/PRP$ visible/JJ and/CC open/JJ displays/NNS and/CC representations/NNS ?/. ./.
S1,But/CC the/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN you/PRP insist/VBP on/IN always/RB mischaracterizing/VBG that/IN as/IN bigotry/NN ./.
S1,"it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT very/RB ugly/RB word/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP suspect/VBP that/DT is/VBZ the/DT reason/NN you/PRP use/VBP it/PRP (/( for/IN its/PRP$ effect/NN )/) and/CC why/WRB you/PRP do/VBP not/RB entertain/VB the/DT idea/NN that/IN bigotry/NN may/MD not/RB always/RB be/VB what/WP is/VBZ behind/IN it/PRP ./."
S2,"I/PRP say/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, and/CC I/PRP explain/VBP why/WRB ./."
S2,"Replace/NNP the/DT word/NN ""/NNP gay/NN ""/NN with/IN another/DT minority/NN ,/, and/CC tell/VB me/PRP it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB ./."
S2,it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT ugly/JJ thing/NN ./.
S2,I/PRP have/VBP explained/VBN why/WRB I/PRP believe/VBP that/DT is/VBZ what/WP is/VBZ behind/IN it/PRP ./.
S2,"If/IN you/PRP believe/VBP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB that/IN ,/, why/WRB do/VBP not/RB you/PRP tell/VBP me/PRP what/WP is/VBZ behind/IN it/PRP ?/. ./."
S1,I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP all/DT goes/VBZ back/RB to/TO one's/VB motivations/NNS ./.
S1,What/WP I/PRP do/VBP not/RB think/VB you/PRP and/CC some/DT others/NNS understand/VBP is/VBZ that/IN people/NNS often/RB do/VBP not/RB take/VB that/DT stand/NN on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN not/RB liking/VBG gay/NN people/NNS ./.
S1,They/PRP do/VBP it/PRP because/IN of/IN the/DT way/NN they/PRP view/VBP marriage/NN ./.
S1,"If/IN any/DT other/JJ minority/NN came/VBD along/RB wanting/VBG marriage/NN to/TO be/VB changed/VBN from/IN one/CD man/NN and/CC one/CD woman/NN ,/, I/PRP suspect/VBP they/PRP would/MD get/VB the/DT same/JJ response/NN ./."
S2,We/PRP were/VBD not/RB just/RB discussing/VBG marriage/NN specifically/RB ./.
S2,"Somehow/RB whenever/WRB gays/NNS are/VBP involved/VBN ,/, a/DT group/NN of/IN people/NNS take/VBP a/DT stand/NN of/IN being/VBG opposed/VBN ,/, because/IN of/IN the/DT way/NN they/PRP view/VBP one/CD thing/NN or/CC another/DT in/IN society/NN ,/, as/IN being/VBG straight-only/JJ ,/, or/CC excluding/VBG gays/NNS ./."
S2,"Yes/UH ,/, from/IN the/DT anti-gay/JJ crowd/NN ,/, sorry/VBP those/DT who/WP do/VBP not/RB wish/VB to/TO include/VB gays/NNS ./."
S2,"However/RB ,/, no/DT other/JJ identified/JJ minority/NN would/MD want/VB that/IN ,/, because/IN only/RB one/CD minority/NN identifies/VBZ as/IN gay/NN ./."
