S1,"Decades/NNS of/IN effort/NN from/IN the/DT religious/JJ right/JJ ,/, conservative/JJ republicans/NNPS ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ like/NN have/VBP made/VBN gay/NN rights/NNS a/DT poisoned/JJ topic/NN ./."
S1,"it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT tragedy/NN ,/, but/CC saying/VBG the/DT right/JJ thing/NN on/IN this/DT issue/NN will/MD cost/VB you/PRP more/JJR votes/NNS than/IN it/PRP will/MD gain/VB you/PRP ,/, everyone/NN knows/VBZ it/PRP ,/, and/CC no/DT one/NN is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO do/VB it/PRP ./."
S1,it/PRP is/VBZ politics/NNS 101/CD ./.
S1,"The/DT democrats/NNPS ,/, as/IN a/DT whole/JJ ,/, want/VBP to/TO do/VB the/DT right/JJ thing/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP know/VBP that/IN if/IN they/PRP say/VBP so/RB too/RB loudly/RB they/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB in/IN a/DT position/NN to/TO do/VB anything/NN ./."
S1,they/PRP are/VBP forced/VBN to/TO moderate/VB their/PRP$ public/JJ stances/NNS so/RB that/IN they/PRP can/MD get/VB into/IN positions/NNS where/WRB they/PRP can/MD actually/RB take/VB action/NN ./.
S1,"This/DT is/VBZ of/IN course/NN a/DT generalization/NN ,/, but/CC if/IN you/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN a/DT political/JJ party/NN as/IN a/DT whole/NN that/WDT is/VBZ unavoidable/JJ ./."
S2,"So/RB ,/, you/PRP are/VBP basically/RB saying/VBG that/IN Biden/NNP was/VBD lying/VBG through/IN his/PRP$ teeth/NNS when/WRB he/PRP said/VBD he/PRP does/VBZ not/RB support/VB gay/NN marriage/NN ?/.
