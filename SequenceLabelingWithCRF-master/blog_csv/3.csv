S1,The/DT world/NN did/VBD change/NN when/WRB the/DT Mass/NNP ./.
S1,legislature/NN ratified/VBD a/DT court/NN decision/NN for/IN equal/JJ rights/NNS ./.
S1,"It/PRP may/MD be/VB a/DT big/JJ change/NN in/IN a/DT small/JJ state/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT recognition/NN that/IN the/DT winds/NNS of/IN change/NN are/VBP blowing/VBG against/IN homophobic/JJ bigotry/NN ./."
S1,You/PRP are/VBP just/RB going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO get/VB over/IN it/PRP ./.
S1,The/DT world/NN just/RB is/VBZ not/RB as/RB anti-gay/JJ as/IN it/PRP used/VBD to/TO be/VB ./.
S1,"And/CC that/DT means/VBZ that/IN you/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO accept/VB equal/JJ rights/NNS eventually/RB ,/, as/IN gay/JJ marriage/NN ./."
S1,"Presumably/RB you/PRP will/MD hope/VB than/IN in/IN a/DT few/JJ years/NNS ,/, bigots/NNS in/IN Massachusetts/NNP will/MD find/VB enough/JJ votes/NNS to/TO overturn/VB equality/NN ./."
S1,I/PRP think/VBP you/PRP will/MD be/VB out/IN of/IN luck/NN ./.
S2,You/PRP wish/VBP that/IN I/PRP wish/VBP ./.
S2,"Do/VB you/PRP just/RB like/IN to/TO argue/VB for/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN being/VBG argumentative/JJ ?/. you/PRP have/VBP picked/VBN out/RP the/DT one/CD single/JJ thing/NN I/PRP said/VBD there/EX that/IN you/PRP could/MD disagree/VB with/IN and/CC are/VBP making/VBG an/DT issue/NN of/IN it/PRP ,/, not/RB even/RB willing/JJ to/TO agree/VB on/IN anything/NN else/JJ I/PRP said/VBD ./."
S2,"But/CC fine/NN ,/, go/VBP ahead/RB and/CC think/VB this/DT is/VBZ some/DT world-changing/JJ event/NN if/IN it/PRP makes/VBZ you/PRP feel/VB better/JJR ./."
S2,"Well/RB ,/, clearly/RB you/PRP did/VBD not/RB even/RB read/VB my/PRP$ post/NN ./."
S2,(/( shrug/NN )/) ./.
S1,You/PRP have/VBP often/RB posted/VBN here/RB that/IN you/PRP oppose/VBP gay/JJ marriage/NN ./.
S1,That/DT means/VBZ you/PRP oppose/VBP equal/JJ rights/NNS for/IN gays/NNS ./.
S1,"If/IN you/PRP have/VBP changed/VBN your/PRP$ mind/NN ,/, and/CC hope/VBP that/IN Massachusetts/NNP does/VBZ not/RB overturn/VB gay/JJ marriage/NN ,/, you/PRP would/MD have/VB said/VBD so/RB ./."
S1,"Since/IN you/PRP didn't/VBP ,/, you/PRP don't/VBP ./."
S2,"No/DT ,/, you/PRP said/VBD you/PRP I/PRP ""/VBP will/MD hope/VB than/IN in/IN a/DT few/JJ years/NNS ,/, bigots/NNS in/IN Massachusetts/NNP will/MD find/VB enough/JJ votes/NNS to/TO overturn/VB equality/NN ""/NN ./."

S2,Clearly/RB you/PRP did/VBD not/RB read/VB my/PRP$ post/NN ./.
S1,"Are/NNP you/PRP claiming/VBG now/RB you/PRP are/VBP in/IN favour/NN of/IN legal/JJ marriage/NN for/IN gays/NNS in/IN Massachusetts/NNP now/RB the/DT legislature/NN has/VBZ voted/VBN for/IN it/PRP ?/. Because/IN if/IN so/RB ,/, that/DT would/MD be/VB a/DT change/NN ./."
S2,"I/PRP am/VBP saying/VBG that/IN I/PRP would/MD not/RB want/VB an/DT amendment/NN put/NN in/IN place/NN banning/VBG it/PRP ,/, because/IN that/DT would/MD be/VB an/DT over-intrusion/NN into/IN peoples/NNS '/POS lives/NNS by/IN the/DT government/NN ./."
S2,"So/RB naturally/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD not/RB want/VB such/JJ an/DT amendment/NN voted/VBD into/IN creation/NN ,/, either/CC ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP took/VBD issue/NN with/IN your/PRP$ claim/NN that/IN I/PRP would/MD ./."
S2,that/DT is/VBZ been/VBN my/PRP$ position/NN here/RB for/IN as/RB long/JJ as/IN I/PRP remember/VBP ./.
S2,"And/CC it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT true/JJ conservative/JJ position/NN (/( as/IN opposed/VBN to/TO neocon/NNS )/) ,/, BTW/NNP ./."
