S2,"But/CC I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN you/PRP abandoned/VBD your/PRP$ silly/JJ argument/NN that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT violation/NN of/IN the/DT First/NNP Amendment/NNP to/TO enact/VB her/PRP$ religious/JJ belief/NN about/IN marriage/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB a/DT violation/NN of/IN the/DT First/NNP Amendment/NNP to/TO enact/VB YOUR/NNP religious/JJ belief/NN about/IN marriage/NN ./."

S2,"""/NN ./."
S1,Because/IN I/PRP am/VBP only/RB concerned/VBN with/IN rights/NNS of/IN gay/NN people/NNS ./.
S1,Gay/JJ people/NNS are/VBP my/PRP$ first/JJ concern/NN ./.
S1,This/DT evil/JJ woman/NN should/MD come/VB out/RP and/CC sayshe/NN is/VBZ anti/JJ gay/NN ./.
S1,She/PRP should/MD come/VB out/RP and/CC say/VB she/PRP does/VBZ not/RB want/VB gay/NN people/NNS to/TO get/VB married/JJ ./.
S1,She/PRP should/MD admit/VB that/IN she/PRP wants/VBZ gay/JJ people/NNS to/TO remain/VB second/JJ class/NN citizens/NNS ./.
S1,Why/WRB does/VBZ not/RB she/PRP own/VB up/RB to/TO her/PRP$ discrimination/NN ?/. She/PRP wants/VBZ to/TO protect/VB her/PRP$ heterosexual/JJ privledge/NN ./.
S1,For/IN the/DT record/NN I/PRP own/VBP that/DT statement/NN and/CC stand/VBP behind/IN it/PRP ./.
S1,I/PRP will/MD talk/VB people/NNS out/IN of/IN attending/VBG these/DT bible/JJ churches/NNS ./.
S1,I/PRP will/MD do/VB what/WP I/PRP can/MD to/TO legally/RB disrupt/VB any/DT rundrasining/VBG activities/NNS they/PRP have/VBP going/VBG ./.
S1,I/PRP will/MD protest/VB their/PRP$ wedding/NN ceremonies/NNS ./.
S1,I/PRP will/MD protest/VB their/PRP$ church/NN services/NNS ./.
S1,"As/RB far/RB as/IN I/PRP am/VBP concerned/JJ ,/, once/RB they/PRP crossed/VBD over/IN the/DT line/NN and/CC started/VBD pushing/VBG for/IN and/CC getting/VBG laws/NNS enacted/VBN that/IN hurt/NN me/PRP ,/, my/PRP$ family/NN ,/, ands/VBZ my/PRP$ people/NNS ,/, they/PRP have/VBP no/DT place/NN in/IN society/NN ./."
S2,"And/CC you/PRP have/VBP yet/RB to/TO show/VB why/WRB this/DT is/VBZ not/RB a/DT legitimate/JJ viewpoint/NN ,/, nor/CC a/DT legitimate/JJ way/NN to/TO legislate/VB this/DT issue/NN ./."
S2,it/PRP is/VBZ obvious/JJ that/IN all/DT you/PRP care/VBP about/IN is/VBZ gay/JJ people/NNS ./.
S2,"However/RB ,/, you/PRP have/VBP not/RB shown/VBN why/WRB anti-gay/JJ (/( as/IN you/PRP call/VBP them/PRP )/) people/NNS should/MD not/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO legislate/VB their/PRP$ view/NN ./."
S2,All/DT you/PRP have/VBP said/VBD is/VBZ that/IN you/PRP do/VBP not/RB like/VB their/PRP$ view/NN ./.
S2,"Big/JJ deal/NN ,/, they/PRP do/VBP not/RB like/IN your/PRP$ view/NN either/CC ./."
S2,"Thus/RB ,/, in/IN a/DT democracy/NN like/IN ours/NNS ,/, the/DT majority/NN of/IN people/NNS decide/VBP issues/NNS like/IN this/DT ./."
S2,"Besides/IN that/DT ,/, I/PRP think/VBP coming/VBG out/RP in/IN support/NN of/IN a/DT Constitutional/NNP Amendment/NNP banning/VBG gay/JJ marriage/NN qualifies/NNS as/IN ""/JJ com/NN [/NN ing/VBG ]/PRP out/IN and/CC say/VB [/JJ ing/VBG ]/NN that/IN she/PRP does/VBZ not/RB want/VB gay/NN people/NNS to/TO get/VB married/JJ ./."
S2,"""/NN This/DT is/VBZ fine/JJ ./."
S2,But/CC also/RB understand/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ legitimate/JJ for/IN people/NNS who/WP believe/VBP like/IN Ms/NNP ./.
S2,"Musgrave/NNP to/TO do/VB the/DT same/JJ ,/, including/VBG to/TO use/VB the/DT democratic/JJ process/NN to/TO have/VB her/PRP$ view/NN enacted/VBN in/IN law/NN ./."
S2,"If/IN you/PRP are/VBP free/JJ to/TO do/VB it/PRP ,/, then/RB she/PRP is/VBZ as/RB well/RB ./."
S1,Should/MD the/DT majority/NN have/VBP the/DT right/NN to/TO enslave/VB their/PRP$ fellow/NN citizens/NNS ?/. Should/MD the/DT majority/NN have/VBP the/DT right/NN to/TO lock/VB people/NNS up/RP in/IN concentration/NN camps/NNS ?/. A/DT majority/NN of/IN the/DT people/NNS in/IN the/DT US/NNP once/RB thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ idea/NN ./.
S1,Oh/UH I/PRP want/VBP the/DT evil/JJ woman/NN to/TO say/VB it/PRP ./.
S1,I/PRP want/VBP her/PRP$ viciousness/NN and/CC ugliness/JJ out/RP in/IN the/DT open/JJ ./.
S1,If/IN she/PRP is/VBZ anti/JJ gay/NN then/RB she/PRP needs/VBZ to/TO own/VB up/RB to/TO her/PRP$ bigotry/NN Repent/NNP America/NNP believes/VBZ in/IN protesting/VBG and/CC disrupting/VBG gay/JJ gatherings/NNS ./.
S1,Why/WRB If/IN they/PRP can/MD do/VB this/DT I/PRP can/MD do/VB the/DT same/JJ ./.
