S1 and S2 are discussing a legislative action associated with a Massachusetts court ruling which is favorable to gay rights.
@highlight
S1 is enthusiastic about the matter and sees it as a step in the right direction against bigotry, and a recognition that the world is not as anti-gay as it used to be, which S2 is advised to acknowledge and accept.
@highlight
S1 also accuses S2 of being inconsistent in having been on the record on the website opposing gay marriage (and therefor according to S1 being opposed to equal rights for gays), but now also taking a position that the state should not intervene to ban gay marriage.
@highlight
S2 defends that position and argues it is based on conservative principles against intrusions into individual lives.
