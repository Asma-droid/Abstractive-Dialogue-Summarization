S1,Agreed/NNP She/PRP is/VBZ ignoring/VBG my/PRP$ religious/JJ freedom/NN and/CC trying/VBG to/TO institute/VB her/PRP$ religion/NN into/IN law/NN ./.
S1,The/DT law/NN that/WDT will/MD bar/VB my/PRP$ family/NN from/IN legal/JJ protections/NNS ./.
S1,It/PRP will/MD not/RB protect/VB her/PRP$ marriage/NN but/CC will/MD bar/VB me/PRP and/CC my/PRP$ people/NNS from/IN from/IN being/VBG full/JJ citizens/NNS ./.
S1,She/PRP is/VBZ not/RB protecting/JJ marriage/NN but/CC perserving/VBG her/PRP$ heterosexual/JJ privledge/NN ./.
S2,How/WRB on/IN earth/NN is/VBZ she/PRP impeding/VBG on/IN you/PRP religious/JJ freedom/NN ?/. She/PRP is/VBZ not/RB trying/VBG to/TO take/VB away/RP your/PRP$ right/JJ to/TO any/DT religious/JJ ceremony/NN ./.
S2,"With/IN such/PDT a/DT wide-open/JJ standard/NN of/IN what/WP constitutes/VBZ religious/JJ freedom/NN that/IN you/PRP seem/VBP to/TO have/VB ,/, any/DT legislation/NN could/MD be/VB construed/VBN as/IN imposing/VBG on/IN religious/JJ freedom/NN ./."
S1,Because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ her/PRP religious/JJ belief/NN that/DT marriage/NN is/VBZ between/IN a/DT man/NN and/CC a/DT woman/NN ./.
S1,My/PRP$ religious/JJ belief/NN is/VBZ that/DT marriage/NN is/VBZ between/IN two/CD people/NNS that/IN love/VBP each/DT other/JJ regardless/NN of/IN sex/NN ./.
S1,She/PRP is/VBZ tying/VBG to/TO place/VB her/PRP$ religious/JJ belif/NN into/IN law/NN over/IN mine/NN ./.
S1,Who/WP gets/VBZ hurt/VBN here/RB ?/. If/IN my/PRP$ religious/JJ belief/NN is/VBZ put/VBN into/IN law/NN she/PRP can/MD still/RB marry/VB the/DT person/NN of/IN her/PRP$ choice/NN ./.
S1,If/IN her/PRP$ religious/JJ belief/JJ gets/VBZ put/VBN into/IN law/NN she/PRP can/MD still/RB marry/VB the/DT person/NN of/IN her/PRP$ choice/NN but/CC I/PRP do/VBP not/RB get/VB to/TO ./.
S1,So/RB I/PRP and/CC my/PRP$ people/NNS are/VBP hurt/VBN by/IN codifing/VBG her/PRP$ religious/JJ belief/NN into/IN law/NN ./.
S1,She/PRP is/VBZ trying/VBG to/TO keep/VB gay/NN people/NNS out/IN of/IN marriage/NN and/CC thus/RB preserve/VB her/PRP$ heterosexual/JJ privledge/NN ./.
S2,"But/CC by/IN that/DT definition/NN ,/, either/DT one/CD could/MD be/VB viewed/VBN as/IN impeding/VBG on/IN religious/JJ freedom/NN ,/, including/VBG your/PRP$ view/NN impeding/VBG on/IN hers!/NN We/PRP do/VBP not/RB define/VB imposing/VBG on/IN religious/JJ freedom/NN on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN having/VBG different/JJ ideals/NNS ./."
S2,It/PRP does/VBZ not/RB effect/NN your/PRP$ religion/NN or/CC religious/JJ freedom/NN if/IN you/PRP do/VBP not/RB get/VB benefits/NNS under/IN gay/NN marriages/NNS ./.
S2,"You/PRP can/MD argue/VB in/IN other/JJ ways/NNS ,/, on/IN other/JJ basis/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT idea/NN that/IN not/RB giving/VBG gays/NNS marriage/NN benefits/NNS is/VBZ imposing/VBG on/IN religious/JJ freedom/NN is/VBZ an/DT empty/JJ ""/NN argument/NN ""/NN ./."
S1,But/CC you/PRP have/VBP not/RB shown/VBN how/WRB she/PRP would/MD be/VB harmed/VBN by/IN equal/JJ marriage/NN ?/. I/PRP have/VBP shown/VBN that/IN her/PRP$ definition/NN infringes/VBZ upon/IN my/PRP$ religious/JJ freedom/NN ./.
S1,If/IN gay/JJ marriage/NN becomes/VBZ a/DT reality/NN then/RB in/IN no/DT way/NN does/VBZ it/PRP infringe/VB upon/IN her/PRP$ in/IN any/DT way/NN ./.
S1,Would/MD you/PRP care/VB to/TO explain/VB how/WRB gay/JJ marriage/NN infringes/VBZ upon/IN her/PRP$ in/IN any/DT way/NN ?/. It/PRP is/VBZ her/PRP heterosexual/JJ privledge/NN and/CC her/PRP$ sence/NN of/IN entitlement/NN that/IN she/PRP is/VBZ protecting/VBG not/RB marriage/VB ./.
S2,"You/PRP may/MD (/( or/CC may/MD not/RB )/) can/MD show/VB harm/NN in/IN another/DT sense/NN ,/, but/CC you/PRP certainly/RB have/VBP NOT/NNP shown/VBN how/WRB your/PRP$ religious/JJ rights/NNS are/VBP taken/VBN away/RB or/CC harmed/VBN ,/, to/TO begin/VB with/IN ./."
S2,that/DT is/VBZ the/DT point/NN ./.
S2,You/PRP certainly/RB have/VBP not/RB shown/VBN how/WRB her/PRP$ definition/NN infringes/VBZ upon/IN your/PRP$ religious/JJ freedom/NN --/: you/PRP are/VBP still/RB free/JJ to/TO be/VB just/RB as/RB religious/JJ in/IN practice/NN and/CC belief/NN as/IN ever/RB if/IN Musgrave's/NNP views/VBZ became/VBD law/NN ./.
S2,you/PRP are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO use/VB a/DT religious/JJ freedom/NN argument/NN here/RB and/CC it/PRP just/RB does/VBZ not/RB fit/VB ./.
S1,Yes/UH I/PRP have/VBP ./.
S1,have/VB not/RB you/PRP been/VBN poaying/VBG attention/NN ?/. ]/NN Because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ her/PRP religious/JJ belief/NN that/DT marriage/NN is/VBZ between/IN a/DT man/NN and/CC a/DT woman/NN ./.
S1,My/PRP$ religious/JJ belief/NN is/VBZ that/DT marriage/NN is/VBZ between/IN two/CD people/NNS that/IN love/VBP each/DT other/JJ regardless/NN of/IN sex/NN ./.

S2,Ok!/NNP My/NNP religious/JJ belief/NN says/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO smoke/VB in/IN public/JJ non-smoking/JJ areas/NNS ./.

S2,"Gee/NNP ,/, this/DT it/PRP fun/VBZ ,/, using/VBG religion/NN as/IN an/DT excuse/NN and/CC means/VBZ to/TO an/DT end/NN to/TO fight/VB legislation!/VB Too/NNP bad/JJ for/IN you/PRP it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB work/VB that/DT way/NN ./."
S2,"What/WP you/PRP do/VBP not/RB get/VB is/VBZ that/IN ,/, by/IN your/PRP$ standard/NN ,/, EITHER/NNP would/MD be/VB placing/VBG one/CD religion/NN over/IN another/DT ./."
S2,The/DT same/JJ justification/NN could/MD be/VB made/VBN against/IN your/PRP$ view/NN because/IN your/PRP$ view/NN goes/VBZ against/IN MY/NNP religious/JJ belief/NN ./.
S2,"And/CC then/RB if/IN you/PRP say/VBP ""/NNS but/CC your/PRP$ view/NN causes/VBZ harm/NN and/CC mine/NN does/VBZ not/RB ""/VB then/RB it/PRP is/VBZ no/RB longer/RBR a/DT religious/JJ issue/NN so/IN the/DT point/NN is/VBZ moot/VBN to/TO begin/VB with/IN ./."
S1,YOu/NNS missed/VBD the/DT point/NN here/RB she/PRP is/VBZ trying/VBG to/TO turn/VB her/PRP$ religious/JJ belief/NN into/IN law/NN that/IN bars/VBZ me/PRP from/IN from/IN getting/VBG married/VBN ./.

S2,"She/PRP may/MD just/RB happen/VB to/TO believe/VB that/DT way/NN religiously/RB ,/, but/CC be/VB pushing/VBG for/IN the/DT law/NN because/IN she/PRP thinks/VBZ that/DT is/VBZ best/RBS for/IN socety/NN ./."
S2,"IOW/NNP ,/, you/PRP have/VBP no/DT idea/NN if/IN religion/NN is/VBZ her/PRP$ real/JJ motivation/NN for/IN the/DT law/NN ./."
