S1,"Romans/NNPS did/VBD it/PRP ,/, so/RB did/VBD celts/NNS ,/, greeks/VBZ This/DT one/CD focuses/VBZ on/IN marriage/NN in/IN american-indian/JJ tribes/NNS ,/, and/CC how/WRB the/DT homosexuals/NNS were/VBD actually/RB greatly/RB valued/VBN as/IN healers/NNS and/CC prophets/NNS ./."
S1,Just/RB take/VB a/DT look/NN at/IN the/DT Old/NNP Testament/NNP to/TO find/VB marriages/NNS between/IN one/CD man/NN and/CC many/JJ women/NNS ./.
S1,Polygamy/NNP is/VBZ also/RB present/JJ in/IN African/JJ and/CC Islamic/JJ culture/NN too/RB ./.
S1,"And/CC in/IN some/DT tribes/NNS in/IN Nigeria/NNP ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT culture/NN of/IN polyandry/NN (/( one/CD woman/NN ,/, many/JJ men/NNS )/) ./."
S1,"So/RB marriage/NN is/VBZ not/RB some/DT one/CD man/NN ,/, one/CD woman/NN thing/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN adhered/VBN to/TO since/IN time/NN began/VBD ./."
S1,"As/IN an/DT '/'' ideal/NN '/'' ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ far/RB more/RBR recent/JJ that/IN you/PRP might/MD think/VB ./."
S1,Smiley/NN ./.
S2,Marriage/NN has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN about/IN different/JJ genders/NNS ./.
S2,I/PRP made/VBD no/DT mention/NN of/IN solely/RB one/CD to/TO one/CD ./.
S2,If/IN you/PRP look/VBP closely/RB at/IN history/NN you/PRP will/MD find/VB that/DT marriage/NN (/( a/DT couple/NN of/IN Bhuddist/NNP sects/NNS apart/RB )/) has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN between/IN opposite/JJ genders/NNS ./.
S2,There/EX have/VBP been/VBN cultures/NNS where/WRB homosexual/JJ relationships/NNS have/VBP existed/VBN for/IN short/JJ periods/NNS and/CC often/RB for/IN specific/JJ cultural/JJ purposes/NNS but/CC marriage/NN per/FW se/NN has/VBZ been/VBN between/IN opposite/JJ genders/NNS ./.
S1,Evidently/RB you/PRP did/VBD not/RB read/VB the/DT links/NNS I/PRP gave/VBD you/PRP ./.
S1,"To/TO put/VB it/PRP another/DT way/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP many/JJ many/JJ examples/NNS of/IN gay/NN marriage/NN throughout/IN history/NN ./."
S1,This/DT idea/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ new/JJ and/CC abnormal/JJ is/VBZ ridiculous/JJ ./.
S1,Smiley/NN ./.
S2,"I/PRP clearly/RB did/VBD ,/, I/PRP suspect/VBP you/PRP may/MD have/VB but/CC did/VBD not/RB understand/VB ./."
S2,None/NN of/IN those/DT unions/NNS were/VBD accepted/VBN to/TO be/VB marriage/NN but/CC unions/NNS for/IN a/DT particular/JJ purpose/NN ./.
S2,Marriage/NN took/VBD place/NN later/RB between/IN man/NN and/CC woman/NN ./.
S2,Your/PRP$ concept/NN is/VBZ new/JJ ./.
S1,that/DT is/VBZ interesting!!/JJ You/PRP made/VBD the/DT point/NN about/IN marriage/NN having/VBG been/VBN an/DT opposite/JJ sex/NN institution/NN before/IN ./.
S1,I/PRP gave/VBD many/JJ examples/NNS of/IN societies/NNS where/WRB same/JJ sex/NN marriage/NN was/VBD commonplace/NN ./.
S1,You/PRP then/RB said/VBD that/IN they/PRP were/VBD not/RB really/RB marriage/VB because/RB marriage/NN was/VBD something/NN new/JJ ./.
S1,Now/RB you/PRP are/VBP saying/VBG that/IN same/JJ sex/NN marriage/NN has/VBZ been/VBN against/IN society's/NN beliefs/NNS since/IN the/DT year/NN dot/NN ./.
S1,"So/RB is/VBZ marriage/VB a/DT new/JJ thing/NN that/WDT is/VBZ only/RB a/DT male-female/JJ thing/NN ,/, or/CC is/VBZ marriage/JJ something/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN around/IN since/IN the/DT year/NN dot/NN (/( and/CC would/MD include/VB those/DT examples/NNS that/WDT I/PRP gave/VBD -/: American/JJ Indian/JJ berdaches/NNS ,/, gay/JJ marriage/NN within/IN early/JJ Roman/NNP society/NN etc/NN )/) ?/.
