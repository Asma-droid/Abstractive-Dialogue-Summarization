S1,15/CD ./.
S1,"2009/CD 3:32/CD pm/NN EST/NNP In/IN a/DT 11/CD -/: 2/CD vote/NN ,/, the/DT City/NNP Council/NNP of/IN Washington/NNP ,/, DC/NNP voted/VBD for/IN gay/NN marriage/NN ./."
S1,"We/PRP are/VBP a/DT bit/NN short-handed/JJ today/NN ,/, so/RB expect/VB more/JJR about/IN this/DT later/NN ./."
S1,Until/IN then/RB have/VB a/DT sip/NN of/IN the/DT bubbly/NN and/CC congrats/NNS to/TO the/DT District/NNP ./.
S2,Wait/NNP until/IN it/PRP is/VBZ put/VBN on/IN a/DT ballot/NN for/IN the/DT voters/NNS to/TO decide/VB ./.
S2,This/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT first/JJ time/NN that/IN a/DT liberal/JJ government/NN did/VBD not/RB pay/VB attention/NN to/TO the/DT will/MD of/IN the/DT people/NNS ./.
S1,And/CC what/WP is/VBZ the/DT will/MD of/IN the/DT people/NNS JP/NNP ?/. People/NNS in/IN support/NN of/IN marriage/NN equality/NN is/VBZ steadily/RB growing/VBG ./.
S1,Compare/VB the/DT polls/NNS from/IN ten/CD years/NNS ago/RB to/TO now/RB to/TO see/VB ./.
S1,It/PRP is/VBZ only/RB a/DT matter/NN of/IN time/NN before/IN equality/NN stands/VBZ upon/IN the/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT majority/NN ./.
S2,"I/PRP keep/VBP hearing/VBG gays/NNS say/VBP that/IN but/CC every/DT time/NN it/PRP is/VBZ put/VBN to/TO a/DT vote/NN ,/, you/PRP lose/VBP ./."
S2,I/PRP had/VBD say/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ time/NN to/TO try/VB another/DT tact/NN because/IN the/DT current/JJ one/NN is/VBZ a/DT losing/JJ proposition/NN ./.
S2,The/DT only/JJ thing/NN forcing/VBG gay/JJ marriage/NN on/IN a/DT population/NN does/VBZ is/VBZ galvanize/VB them/PRP against/IN the/DT forced/JJ action/NN ./.
S2,"And/CC when/WRB they/PRP respond/VBP on/IN the/DT ballot/NN ,/, they/PRP do/VBP so/RB punatively/RB ./."
S2,Just/RB wait/NN until/IN you/PRP see/VBP the/DT repercussions/NNS of/IN the/DT current/JJ efforts/NNS to/TO give/VB ALL/DT Federal/NNP Employee's/NNP same/JJ sex/NN partners/NNS bennies/NNS on/IN OUR/NNP DIME/NNP despite/IN DOMA/NNP ./.
S2,I/PRP am/VBP guessing/VBG that/IN some/DT additional/JJ Democratic/JJ heads/NNS will/MD roll/VB in/IN the/DT fall/NN election/NN if/IN that/DT flies/NNS ./.
S2,You/PRP need/VBP a/DT PR/NNP strategy/NN that/WDT highlights/VBZ the/DT advantages/NNS of/IN gay/JJ unions/NNS over/IN bathhouse/NN and/CC gay/JJ bar/NN existences/NNS ./.
S2,I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN a/DT true/JJ majority/NN of/IN people/NNS would/MD support/VB civil/JJ unions/NNS but/CC NOT/NNP marriage/VB ./.
S2,And/CC I/PRP count/VBP myself/PRP amongst/VBZ that/IN majority/NN ./.
S1,Actually/RB JP/NNP so/IN far/RB 5/CD states/NNS have/VBP passed/VBN gay/JJ marriage/NN so/RB no/RB not/RB every/DT time/NN it/PRP is/VBZ put/VBN to/TO a/DT vote/NN do/VBP we/PRP lose/VB ./.
S1,And/CC how/WRB am/VBP I/PRP forcing/VBG anyone/NN to/TO accept/VB gay/JJ marriage/NN ?/. Am/VBP I/PRP forcing/VBG these/DT voters/NNS to/TO attend/VB my/PRP$ wedding/NN or/CC dare/NN I/PRP say/VBP be/VB in/IN a/DT marriage/NN themselves/PRP ?/. And/CC I/PRP cannot/VBP agree/JJ with/IN you/PRP more/VBP about/IN changing/VBG the/DT image/NN of/IN the/DT gay/NN community/NN as/IN a/DT whole/NN ./.
S1,We/PRP are/VBP not/RB all/PDT a/DT bunch/NN of/IN promiscuous/JJ sex/NN crazed/JJ people/NNS running/VBG around/RB ./.
S1,"What/WP I/PRP find/VBP funny/JJ is/VBZ once/RB strait/JJ people/NNS find/VBP out/RP how/WRB boring/JJ we/PRP really/RB are/VBP ,/, and/CC how/WRB we/PRP pay/VBP taxes/NNS just/RB like/IN every/DT other/JJ joe/NN schmo/NN they/PRP will/MD think/VB nothing/NN more/JJR of/IN special/JJ rights/NNS lol/NN ./."
S1,But/CC actually/RB like/IN I/PRP stated/VBD earlier/RBR in/IN another/DT thread/NN if/IN those/DT unions/NNS constituted/VBD the/DT same/JJ legal/JJ rights/NNS as/IN married/JJ couples/NNS I/PRP would/MD be/VB content/JJ ./.
S2,"Which/JJ 5/CD states/NNS put/VBD gay/JJ marriage/NN on/IN the/DT ballot/NN and/CC it/PRP won/VBD ?/. To/TO the/DT best/JJS of/IN my/PRP$ knowledge/NN ,/, no/DT state/NN that/WDT has/VBZ gay/VBN marriage/NN today/NN has/VBZ ever/RB gotten/VBN it/PRP via/IN the/DT ballot/NN ./."
S2,It/PRP has/VBZ either/RB been/VBN the/DT court/NN or/CC legislature/NN that/WDT has/VBZ forced/VBN it/PRP on/IN the/DT state/NN ./.
S2,The/DT gays/NNS I/PRP know/VBP are/VBP as/RB boring/JJ as/IN Mr/NNP and/CC Mrs/NNP John/NNP Q/NNP ./.
S2,"Public/NNP as/RB well/RB ,/, but/CC that/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT image/NN that/WDT is/VBZ portrayed/VBN to/TO the/DT general/JJ public/NN ./."
S2,"Like/IN I/PRP said/VBD ,/, you/PRP have/VBP a/DT PR/NNP problem/NN ./."
S2,"I/PRP think/VBP that/IN if/IN more/JJR gays/NNS were/VBD willing/JJ to/TO settle/VB for/IN civil/JJ unions/NNS that/WDT were/VBD more/RBR equivalent/JJ to/TO marriage/VB ,/, you/PRP would/MD have/VB an/DT easier/JJR time/NN gaining/VBG legal/JJ acceptance/NN ./."
S1,Ok/NNP maybe/RB not/RB the/DT ballot/NN ./.
S1,Got/NNP me/PRP there/EX man/NN ./.

S1,And/CC yeah/NN we/PRP got/VBD a/DT MAJOR/NNP PR/NNP problem/NN big/JJ time/NN ./.
S1,And/CC I/PRP said/VBD as/RB long/RB as/IN we/PRP got/VBD the/DT legal/JJ rights/NNS of/IN marriage/NN and/CC called/VBD it/PRP CU/NNP I/PRP would/MD be/VB cool/JJ with/IN that/DT ./.
S1,I/PRP already/RB wear/VBP a/DT dress/NN and/CC heels/NNS enough/RB as/IN it/PRP is!/VBZ lmao/JJ jk/NN ./.
