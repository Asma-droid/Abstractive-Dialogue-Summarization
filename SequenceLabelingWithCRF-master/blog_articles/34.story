Should they ? What are western standards ? What were they 20 yrs ago ? What were they 100 yrs ago ? Marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . Where would that put families started by artificial insemination ? . The same as any other heterosexual couple . it is not the way children are created ( adopted , serrogacy , etc ) . It ' s the nature of the relationship ( heterosexual ) . Natural refers to nature not child bearing . Their shamans told them that the warriors could only marry outer warriors . To be with a women , they thought , might make then softer , and more woman like , and not as fearless in combat . Ok , so conceiving a child is not what makes it nature , what is it ? Wouldn t polygamy also include some of that same sex taboo , to women marred together ? Why do S1 feel S1's  values are right and others that disagree as wrong ? . Polygamy is not women married together . it is one man or women married to multiple of the opposite sex like a harem or entourage . Everyone feels their values are right or else they would not believe in them . What we value shows . Of course atheist do not believe in God so they have a different set of values . S1 of course believe in God first , family second , and country third . If S2 have different values then of course S2 will think yours are better if not then S2 would not have them . Our values are what guide us . S1 feel that from perspective S1's  values give someone a better balance and stability to function in society . S2 probably think otherwise but S1 feel statistically S1 can support mine . Sorry , S2 don t practice Polygamy ; S2 don t know the inner workings of the family . S2 would think it would be a good way for bi-sexual to stay below the radar . S2 worded the question badly ; S2 should have asked why do S1 feel that S1's  morals should be forced on to others ? By keeping the laws the way they are now it is discrimination . Correct S2 if S2 am wrong , but S2 did not think S1 could fire some one for being gay . There is only one case that was prosecuted in recent history ( that was mostly due to one of his wives being 14 when married .

S1 makes the claim that marriage is defined as a family unit based on natural heterosexual contact, and suggests that it is the heterosexual nature of the relationship that is important, not how the children are conceived within the relationship.

He argues that homosexuals are attempting to force their morals on others by legalizing same-sex marriage, claiming that legalizing a behavior is a tacit form of acceptance that will affect society.

S2 questions the religious basis of a civil ceremony like marriage, suggesting that the stipulations based on religious reasons would vary depending on the chosen religion.

He also compares homosexuality to polygamy, claiming that polygamy has been unofficially accepted for years, and argues that maintaining the current same-sex marriage bans should be considered discriminatory.
