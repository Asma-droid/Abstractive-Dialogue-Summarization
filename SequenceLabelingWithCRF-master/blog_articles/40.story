The number of earthquales that have happened outside of Israel in the last 100 yrs is exponentially increased . Believe what S2 will . If S2 have a better understanding of love waxing cold S1 had like to hear it . Obviously we do not have the smae understanding of the US government . Teh majority rules unless it violates the constitution . If S2 can point out how that is not true then S1 had be interested in being enlightened . :p OK , if S1 say so . looked at the lists of " World's Most Dangerous Earthquakes and Selected Earthquakes in the United States " from The Citizen's Guide to Geologic Hazards . S1 thought it best to look just at the larger earthquakes to reduce the dependence on instruments and observers . There has been about 20 large earthquakes globally in the latter half of this century ( so far ) compared to about 15 for the first half of this century . There were only 7 large earthquakes recorded for the entire 19th century . Based on this quick look at one source of information , it does appear that the frequency of earthquakes is increasing . Mana'ia , S2 can only shake S2's  at S1 sometimes . It is rather typical of S1's  posts though . ACtually S1 did take taht fact inot consideration . The new methoods detect min or earthquakes and mostly do it in remote places . S1 am talking ab out teh major earthquakes taht could be detected wihtout a seizmograph in the major countries in the civilized world . The evidence of teh earthquakes that could be measured in the 1800 s in teh countries documented compared to thiose same earthquakes now are expontially increasing . We doin ; t need to count the minor ones in remote places . Go to ANY and ALL sources and count them . S1 did S1's  research but S2 obviously didn't . Still remember that S2 also are only specualting thqat it the reason for more . Mana'ia , See S2's  first response to S1's  earthquake nonsense . Research hey Waxy .

S1 claims that the number of earthquakes occurring outside of Israel has increased in the last hundred years, comparing 20 large earthquakes in the latter half of the 20th century to only 15 large earthquakes in the first half of the 20th century, and only 7 large earthquakes in the entire 19th century.
@highlight
S1 argues that this information is clear evidence that the frequency of earthquakes is increasing over time.
@highlight
S2 refutes S1 claim of increasing earthquake frequency, suggesting that the greater number of earthquakes detected could be a matter of increases in our ability to detect earthquakes rather than an actual increase in the number of earthquakes occurring.
@highlight
S1 takes this point into consideration, but claims that the evidence still supports his original claim.
