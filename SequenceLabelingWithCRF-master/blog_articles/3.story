S2 wish . But however much S1 disagree with Sullivan on many political issues , he has right about that . The world did change when the Mass . legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . It may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry . S2 are just going to have to get over it . The world just is not as anti-gay as it used to be . And that means that S2 are going to have to accept equal rights eventually , as gay marriage . Presumably S2 will hope than in a few years , bigots in Massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality . S1 think S2 will be out of luck . S1 wish that S2 wish . Do S1 just like to argue for the sake of being argumentative ? S1 have picked out the one single thing S2 said there that S1 could disagree with and are making an issue of it , not even willing to agree on anything else S2 said . But fine , go ahead and think this is some world-changing event if it makes S1 feel better . Well , clearly S1 did not even read S2's  post . S2 have often posted here that S2 oppose gay marriage . That means S2 oppose equal rights for gays . If S2 have changed S2's  mind , and hope that Massachusetts does not overturn gay marriage , S2 would have said so . Since S2 didn't , S2 don't . No , S1 said S1 S2 " will hope than in a few years , bigots in Massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality " . S2 had said , very plainly , that S2 think such legislation is an over-intrusion by the government . Clearly S1 did not read S2's  post . S2 am saying that S2 would not want an amendment put in place banning it , because that would be an over-intrusion into peoples ' lives by the government . So naturally , S2 would not want such an amendment voted into creation , either , and that is why S2 took issue with S1's  claim that S2 would . that is been S2's  position here for as long as S2 remember . And it is a true conservative position ( as opposed to neocon ) , BTW .
@highlight
S1 and S2 are discussing a legislative action associated with a Massachusetts court ruling which is favorable to gay rights.
@highlight
S1 is enthusiastic about the matter and sees it as a step in the right direction against bigotry, and a recognition that the world is not as anti-gay as it used to be, which S2 is advised to acknowledge and accept.
@highlight
S1 also accuses S2 of being inconsistent in having been on the record on the website opposing gay marriage (and therefor according to S1 being opposed to equal rights for gays), but now also taking a position that the state should not intervene to ban gay marriage.
@highlight
S2 defends that position and argues it is based on conservative principles against intrusions into individual lives.
