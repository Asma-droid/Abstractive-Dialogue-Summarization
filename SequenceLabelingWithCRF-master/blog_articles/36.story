S2 just did a google search and could not find a Dominionist Web Site at all . The only articles S2 could find on this devious organization are from radical Left leaning groups that S2 believe are making this group up as a red herring to create a reason to promote fear of Christians . Just go to Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson and learn what S2 need to know . If S1 could , S1 would have . This is just one more example of the diabolical agenda of the Radical Left to make people fear Christianity based on more lies and deception . Thanks for revealing who the real paranoid fearmongers are .

S1 suggests that a Christian sect known as the Domionists are focused only on gaining power, citing Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson as his sources.

S2 claims that he was unable to find any evidence of Domionists practices online except from left wing groups.

He suggests that the Dimionists are not a real religious group, but rather are a group invented by left wing groups to make people fear Christianity, and further argues that left leaning individuals rely on lying to achieve their goals because they are unfamiliar with the truth.
@highlight
He also presents an absurd story about people on the political left being Satan worshipers in order to demonstrate how posting information without evidence to back it up does not make it automatically true.
