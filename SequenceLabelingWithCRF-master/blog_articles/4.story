Certainly not yours . S2 should know that S1 am for no marriage in government . It should be left to a religious institution where it will actually mean something . The states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does not reward people like Britney Spears for being white trash . That is all well and good , but it is not the religious ceremony and sanction that gays are looking for . They already have that ; there are churches that perform same-sex marriages . It is the civil benefits that are at issue . S1 am saying that there should be a better system . For example , if S2 had a best friend who S2 are roommates with . both hetero for the sake of argument . and never wish to get married then could they get some of the benefits S2 described ? S1's  Uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with . It just seems the single folks are the ones getting screwed over in the marriage deal :) . Ok , lets use that logic . To the gay folks S1 say marry a woman . Bet S2 are not happy with that :) .
@highlight
S1 and S2 discuss the civil benefits of marriage and how they could or could not be extended to single people and gay people.
@highlight
S1 is initially against government being involved in the equation, but after S2 describes many of the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage, such as automatic inheritance and hospital visitation rights, S1 is then able to relate to the issues by considering the case of his life-long bachelor uncle, suggesting that it is single people who are discriminated against by being excluded from the marriage benefits.
@highlight
S2 suggests that if a single person desires the benefits of marriage, they should marry, but that they should be able to marry a person of either gender as they see fit.
