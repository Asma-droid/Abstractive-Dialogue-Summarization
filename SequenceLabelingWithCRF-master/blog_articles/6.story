S1 find it curious that every time someone makes the correct assertion that AIDS became an epidemic in the US through the gay community , gays and their PC apologists immediately try to deflect the argument and want to talk about Africa . S1 do not give a flying F @#$ about how it spread in Africa ; S1 am talking about the USA . Show S1 that S1's  assertion is inaccurate and S1 will apologize , but do not join the rest of the apologists in trying to change the debate . The topic is AIDS in the US , not Africa , not Asia , not the South Pole . The reason we bring up Africa is to knock down the reason S1 bring up the stats in the US . S1 did not just come along and start a chat about the progression of AIDS in the US . S1 threw it out as justification for those who oppose gay rights . If S1 want to use it like a weapon against gays - then expect tit for tat , JP . The topic is gay marriage IN THE USA . What part of that topic includes Africa ? Please try to keep up . Statements like the above make S2 look flighty . Its S1's  LOGIC we are refuting - location is IRRELEVANT . If S2 want to refute S1's  statement , show S1 some FACTS , not wishes , opinions , feelings , or other means of subterfuge . S1 shall say it again for S2 . AIDS reached critical mass and became an epidemic in the US primarily via the gay community . If S2 do not agree , show proof to support the contrary . It should not be that difficult . If S1 am nothing but a gay-bashing bigot who makes wild claims , then surely S2 can refute S1's  claim with facts pertaining to the topic in bold , cannot S2 ? But , if S1 am actually NOT a gay-bashing bigot and have the facts to back up S1's  claim , then S2 would better continue with the subterfuge , deflection and dismissals because all S2 will have is fraudulent PC rhetoric .

S1 claims that the gay community is the cause of the AIDs epidemic in the US and that homosexuals and their advocates attempt to divert attention from this fact by tracing the origin of the disease to Africa.
@highlight
He believes that the existence of AIDs in Africa has nothing to do with AIDs in the US and that it should be ignored.
@highlight
S2 argues that discussing AIDs in Africa is relevant to AIDs in the US and point out how AIDs is used as a justification for those who oppose gay rights.
@highlight
He suggests that the statistics regarding AIDs in Africa show that it is not simply a homosexual disease and that AIDs should therefore not be used as a justification to make gay marriage illegal.
