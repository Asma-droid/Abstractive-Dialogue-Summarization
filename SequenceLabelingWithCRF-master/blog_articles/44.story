Healthcare usually applies to spouses . Therefore , if it is illegal for gays to marry in VA , he gets no healthcare . it is a fairly simple law to understand . It works the same way with a straight guy who has a girlfriend . she does not get healthcare provided by his job . S1 hope the gays who are upset with VA leave . It will cause less havoc in the state . Which part about not allowing them to become spouses do not S1 get ? The straight guy can marry his girlfriend so she gets the benefits . And the point is , in VA gays cannot get married , therefore they cannot share their gay lover's healthcare . Simple as that . Hopefully gay marriages will be outlawed everywhere so we do not have to continue to hear them bitch and moan about healthcare . Actually if they cohabitate for a prescribed period of time or have children together S2 would say yes . Commonlaw as it were .

S1 claims that because healthcare is generally extended to spouses, homosexuals will not be eligible to receive healthcare through their partner because same-sex marriages are not recognized in Virginia.

He likens this situations to a heterosexual male with a girlfriend who would not receive his healthcare benefits.
@highlight
He presents his opinion that homosexuals should move out of Virginia and his hope that same-sex marriages will be made illegal everywhere.
@highlight
S2 argues that the cases presented by S1 are not equivalent because the heterosexual male has the right to marry his girlfriend if he chooses, at which point she would be eligible for his benefits.

He also points out that after cohabitating for a certain period of time, the woman would be eligible under common law marriage.
