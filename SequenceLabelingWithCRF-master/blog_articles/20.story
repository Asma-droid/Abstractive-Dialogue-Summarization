Any two adults can run the household , one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated , one inherits when the other dies , etc . That parallel does not carry over to group marriages . When one dies , who inherits ? If one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? Basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious . Our marriage laws , for better or worse , are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household . They also assume man and wife , true , but do not actually depend on that . But the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws ; changing that is a huge project . , but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well . let us face it -- if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships , they could pull it off -- polygamy , gays , letting 17 year olds marry , etc . All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed . Means could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . Laws can be worded to do it . See , this is why we try to avoid this debate . Those who oppose gay marriage inevitably put their own spin on it and drag it to silly conclusion . Here we see what gays really want turned into " make marriage an open-ended institution of equality " , which then means gay , poly , and 17 year olds in this case . Jyoshu stopped there , but it is not uncommon for it then to go to children , cousins , dogs , whatever . This issue is not " let us let everyone do anything they like " , that is just the common reframing we see whenever poly relations are brought up while disscusing gay marriage . It happens all the time , it gets old , and that is why people who have gone through it a bunch of times tend to aviod the whole thing . It happens because there is no way to avoid logical conclusions . Believe it or not , cultural and legal precedent is a very real thing . The events in the article exemplify this . If S1 argue to broaden marriage ( which S1 are ) , then this is what S1 have to deal with . As S1 said , S2 DID stop with polygamy , gay , and barely lowering the age of consent , so why are S1 bringing up all the other examples like " children , cousins dogs , " or whatever , as if S1 were ready to pounce on that ? S1 are arguing against degrees that S2 did not even say , or that NO one said . S2 asked Now , do you have any response to my point that your argument boils down to nothing more than " polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it " , or are you just going to avoid it by getting sidetracked by the fact you do not like that we are even talking about this ? Again , society can deal with issues like polygamy if they really want to . S1 disagreed . S2 can start with an erroneous assumption , like S2 did , and then arrive at an illogical conclusion , like S2 did . Why do not S2 read the exchanges between S1 and Phyllis ; S1 think most of S2's  issues will be addressed that way . In S1's  exchange with Phyllis S2 may comment on matters S2 disagree with . Listen to yourself! We start with " gays want to get married " , S2 change it to " make marriage an open-ended institution of equality " , and now S2 segue over to " broadening marriage " . S2's  erroneous assumption is S2's  statement of what gays are trying to accomplish . Until S2 stop trying to change what gays really want into something that S2 can argue against more easily all S2's  arguments will be based on erroneous assumptions . Actually , S1 did address them . While debating with Phyllis . And naturally S1 may ignore them if S1 think they are diversions . What is the crux here is that marriage would be broadened . it is not rocket science . S1 are moving the boundaries of what constitutes a marriage to include MORE than opposite-sex couples . Very straightforward . S2 know S1 do not like it phrased that way , but that is what it is . S1 cannot take a phrase like ' gays want to get married " without looking at the overall implications . In terms of legal rights , S2 do not see why it would be any different . Equality in marriage is equality in marriage regardless of the cultural motivation -- religious , being in love with more than one person , or simply just for the hell of it . For that matter , the argument could be made that opposite-sex marriage between 2 people is largely a religious construct! . S1 shall try to explain this to S2 one more time . The stated purpose of gays is quite relevent if S2 are trying to argue against it . Gays want to get married . One side effect of that is that some people will see the scope of marriage broadened . Gays are not , in and of itself , trying to broaden marriage . They did not wake up one day and say " let us try to broaden the scope of marriage today , that'll be fun! " S2's  arguments run along the lines of " If S2 want to braoden marriage , than S2 must excpet it broadening in all these other ways " and that is why S2's  rephrasing does not work . Broadening marriage is not the goal , it is a side effect , and since it is not the goal we do not have to accept all these other things S2 claim would be the result if they were trying to broaden marriage . To recap , S2's  arguments are based on S2's  assumption that gays want to broaden marriage , that is their ulitmate goal , the pinnacle of the cause . Gays getting married to S2 seems to be the means to that end . That is , of course , backwards , and so S2's  sematic based arguments fail . Kronos , S2 just told S1 S2 am not dealing here with what gays are trying not trying to do in terms of intent , yet S1 are arguing as if S2 never even said that . S2 am not arguing what gays have as intent . S2 completely understand what S1 are saying . S2's  point here is based on the effect of their intents , whatever that intent is . There is simply no way to get around the fact that if S1 change marriage to include other that opposite-sex couples ( to ANY number of other possibilities -- even ONE ) , S1 are broadening marriage . Whether or not gays set out to do this in terms of a goal is irrelevant . S1 are attacking some point about intent that S2 have not made -- S2 am talking about the effect here . To latch onto some straw man of " intent " is to completely miss the point . S1 am not ignoring this post , S1 am simply choosing not to respond because it is a pointless distraction in an otherwise interesing thread . If S2 want to start another thread on this theme S1 shall explain there how wrong S2 are .

S1: Opposers to gay marriage often jump to conclusions about who can get married -why not cousins, group marriages, children, dogs? Polygamous marriage raises legal concerns that are not currently covered in traditional marriage laws, for example.
@highlight
The goal of gay marriage supporters is to be able to get married - not to broaden marriage.
@highlight
Broadened marriage is a side effect of legal gay marriage.
@highlight
S2: Gay marriage supporters want marriage laws changed to accommodate gay marriage.
@highlight
Broadened marriage could change the current traditional marriage laws.
@highlight
Polygamy, for example, would require more marriage laws changed than gay marriage would, as more people are involved.
@highlight
But if enough people wanted legal polygamous marriage, the laws would be passed.
@highlight
Marriage would be broadened if gay marriage is made legal, whether that is the goal of gay marriage or not.
