speaker,pos
Prakhar,I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ time/NN that/IN we/PRP decide/VBP on/IN topic/NN for/IN the/DT NLP/NNP project/NN ./. 
Prakhar,Mausam/NNP sir/VBZ expects/VBZ a/DT paper/NN from/IN the/DT batch/NN ./.
Saket,You/PRP are/VBP right/JJ ./.
Saket,Ummm../NNP ./. 
Saket,I/PRP am/VBP too/RB confused/JJ ./. 
Saket,How/WRB can/MD we/PRP read/VB a/DT paper/NN ./. code/NN it/PRP and/CC improve/VB the/DT baseline/NN within/IN a/DT month/NN ?/. 
Saket,This/DT seems/VBZ too/RB much/JJ to/TO ask/VB for/IN ./.
Prakhar,Haha./NNP ./. 
Prakhar,do/VB not/RB worry./VB ./. 
Prakhar,We/PRP can/MD look/VB for/IN code/NN of/IN a/DT paper/NN online/NN and/CC directly/RB jump/NN on/IN improving/VBG baseline/NN ./.
Prakhar,I/PRP think/VBP finding/VBG a/DT paper/NN with/IN code/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN dataset/NN available/JJ will/MD be/VB a/DT challenge/NN ./.
Saket,Yeah/UH !/. 
Saket,that/DT is/VBZ seem/JJ cool/JJ ./. 
Saket,I/PRP beleive/VBP working/VBG on/IN things/NNS like/IN Sentiment/NNP analysis/NN will/MD be/VB boring/JJ considering/VBG we/PRP already/RB have/VBP done/VBN an/DT assignment/NN on/IN it/PRP ./. 
Saket,Are/NNP you/PRP familiar/JJ with/IN generative/JJ language/NN models/NNS ?/.
Prakhar,Yeahh/UH ./. 
Prakhar,I/PRP too/RB find/VBP them/PRP interesting/VBG ./. 
Prakhar,But/CC Ummm../NNP ./. 
Prakhar,this/DT is/VBZ gonna/JJ be/VB tough/JJ ./. 
Prakhar,I/PRP think/VBP this/DT will/MD require/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN hardwork/NN ./. 
Prakhar,Given/VBN that/IN this/DT semester/NN is/VBZ fully/RB loaded/VBN ./. why/WRB do/VBP you/PRP want/VB to/TO try/VB such/PDT a/DT new/JJ thing/NN ?/.
Saket,I/PRP too/RB believe/VBP generative/JJ models/NNS are/VBP tough/JJ ./. 
Saket,They/PRP will/MD be/VB difficult/JJ to/TO train/VB and/CC implement/VB ./. 
Saket,Trying/VBG new/JJ things/NNS is/VBZ what/WP we/PRP are/VBP here/RB for/IN ./. 
Saket,Challenges/NNS will/MD always/RB be/VB there/RB but/CC we/PRP must/MD learn/VB to/TO handle/VB them/PRP ./. 
Saket,I/PRP am/VBP up/RB for/IN this/DT ./. 
Saket,Rahul/VB What/WDT are/VBP you/PRP planning/VBG of/IN doing/VBG ?/.
Prakhar,I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP have/VBP decided/VBN the/DT domain/NN then/RB ./. 
Prakhar,it/PRP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB on/IN Generative/NNP Model/NNP for/IN sure/JJ now/RB ./.
Rahul,I/PRP am/VBP planning/VBG of/IN doing/VBG something/NN to/TO remove/VB bias/NN words/NNS from/IN Articles/NNP ./.
Saket,Wow/UH !/. 
Saket,that/WDT will/MD be/VB great/JJ ./.
Saket,We/PRP discussed/VBD too/RB much/JJ in/IN this/DT chat/NN ./. 
Saket,Prakhar/NNP ./. why/WRB do/VBP not/RB we/PRP have/VBP something/NN that/WDT can/MD summarize/VB the/DT discussion/NN ?/.
Prakhar,We/PRP can/MD have/VB something/NN like/IN auto/NN discussion/NN summarization/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB based/VBN on/IN Generative/NNP Language/NNP Model/NNP ./.
Saket,I/PRP can/MD agree/VB no/DT more/RBR ./.
Saket,So/RB I/PRP believe/VBP this/DT is/VBZ time/NN to/TO get/VB started/VBN ./.
