David,can/MD anyone/NN confirm/NN or/CC deny/VB this/DT ?/.

Chris,I/PRP am/VBP guessing/VBG you/PRP mean/VBP the/DT ALT=/NNP attribute/NN on/IN the/DT tag/NN ?/.
Chris,no/DT
Chris,"that/DT is/VBZ about/IN what/WP I/PRP would/MD expect/VB to/TO happen/VB ,/, with/IN Word/NNP or/CC any/DT other/JJ wordprocessor/NN ./."
Chris,I/PRP could/MD test/VB this/DT on/IN my/PRP$ system/NN if/IN you/PRP can/MD confirm/VB the/DT scenario:/NN
Chris,"-/: Start/NN with/IN an/DT HTML/NNP document/NN ,/, created/VBN by/IN any/DT means/NNS ./."
Chris,-/: The/DT doc/NN contains/VBZ an/DT with/IN the/DT ALT=/NNP attribute/NN ./.

Chris,"-/: The/DT page/NN is/VBZ as/IN from/IN Word/NNP ,/, without/IN first/JJ saving/VBG it/PRP in/IN Word/NNP format/NN ./."
Chris,PS:/NNP would/MD you/PRP use/VB Word/NNP to/TO edit/VB an/DT HTML/NN
Chris,
Jamie,Many/JJ people/NNS required/VBN to/TO edit/VB and/CC create/VB web/JJ pages/NNS sites/NNS are/VBP not/RB web/JJ professionals/NNS and/CC the/DT only/JJ tool/NN available/JJ to/TO them/PRP is/VBZ Word/NNP ./.
Jamie,I/PRP daresay/VBP that/IN most/JJS people/NNS do/VBP not/RB know/VB HTML/NNP and/CC are/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO learn/VB it/PRP so/RB that/IN they/PRP can/MD make/VB an/DT accessible/JJ page/NN through/IN a/DT text/NN editor/NN ./.
Jamie,This/DT is/VBZ especially/RB true/JJ if/IN the/DT only/JJ editing/NN required/VBN of/IN them/PRP is/VBZ small/JJ such/JJ as/IN changing/VBG the/DT grammar/NN on/IN a/DT web/JJ page/NN or/CC correcting/VBG spelling/NN of/IN a/DT word/NN ./.
Jamie,This/DT is/VBZ exactly/RB why/WRB the/DT authoring/NN tools/NNS aspect/NN of/IN the/DT WAI/NNP is/VBZ so/RB important/JJ ./.

Alan,"MS-Word/NNP has/VBZ elegant/JJ text-editing/JJ commands/NNS that/WDT are/VBP absent/JJ from/IN a/DT basic/JJ text/NN editor/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN make/VBP editing/VBG documents/NNS a/DT pleasure/NN ./."

Alan,"Unfortunately/RB ,/, many/JJ of/IN the/DT really/RB powerful/JJ Word/NNP commands/NNS are/VBP extremely/RB poorly/RB documented/VBN ./."
