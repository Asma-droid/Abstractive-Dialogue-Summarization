Prakhar:I think it is time that we decide on topic for the NLP project .
Prakhar:Mausam sir expects a paper from the batch .
Saket:You are right .
Saket:Ummm.. .
Saket:I am too confused .
Saket:How can we read a paper . code it and improve the baseline within a month ?
Saket:This seems too much to ask for .
Prakhar:Haha. .
Prakhar:do not worry. .
Prakhar:We can look for code of a paper online and directly jump on improving baseline .
Prakhar:I think finding a paper with code as well as dataset available will be a challenge .
Prakhar:Why do not I try something on sentiment analysis ?
Saket:Yeah !
Saket:that is seem cool .
Saket:But I beleive working on things like Sentiment analysis will be boring considering we already hace done an assignment on it .
Saket:Are you familiar with generative language models ?
Prakhar:Yes .
Prakhar:I too find them interesting .
Prakhar:But Ummm.. .
Prakhar:this is gonna be tough .
Prakhar:I think this will require a lot of hardwork .
Prakhar:Given that this semester is fully loaded . why do you want to try such a new thing ?
Rahul:Hi
Saket:I too believe generative models are tough .
Saket:They will be difficult to train and implement .
Saket:Trying new things is what we are here for .
Saket:Challenges will always be there but we must learn to handle them .
Saket:I am up for this .
Saket:Rahul What are you planning of doing ?
Prakhar:I think we have decided the domain then .
Prakhar:it is going to be on Generative Model for sure now .
Rahul:I am planning of doing something to remove bias words from Articles .
Saket:Wow !
Saket:that will be great .
Saket:We discussed too much in this chat .
Saket:Prakhar . why do not we have something that can summarize the discussion ?
Prakhar:We can have something like auto discussion summarization that can be based on Generative Language Model .
Saket:I can agree no more .
Saket:So I believe this is time to get started .
